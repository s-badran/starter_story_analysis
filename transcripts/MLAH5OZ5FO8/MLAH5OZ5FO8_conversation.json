In terms of some cool customers we have, one would be Nike Strength, which was super awesome to get Tom's shoes, which is a pretty massive brand. A bunch of really, really cool brands you work with.

I thought it could be cool to try it as a business, so we did. So we decided that E Commerce would be where we would sell our software. And before it was a pop up, it was kind of more of a loyalty program, an education tool. And the difficulty in me being able to describe to you what it was kind of shows the issue with positioning. We started the company, we had two customers. One was my co founder's cousin and the other was this girl from my class at university. People were like, hey, this is cool, but where does it fit in my tech stack? What do I replace with it? And who are you?",

I wanted to believe my best customers thought of us as an innovative new customer education tool. The hard truth is that they didn't think of us as that. They actually thought of us as a pop up tool. If our best customers think of us as a pop up tool and they pay us for that, you can extrapolate and say that a bunch of other customers who think of us as a pop up tool might pay us some money. I think we should try to become that thing and see how the market responds to it. And the market responded well. And we knew that, hey, this is, this is the golden ticket we have here.",

      "text": "The way we did it is with four main things. The first is changing the copy on the website. So when we revamped our website, the biggest thing is what can this tagline say? As you can see right here, the next generation of pop ups. And when I click on product, this says pop up features. It doesn't say product features because these are only features that exist inside of the pop up, which is all that we do. We are the best at pop ups. Why? And then we answer that why question here. So people are like, okay, cool. Like, this is why. And this makes sense to me. The second is when you make content, you write content about what your business is when you've repositioned it. I actually have a bookmark post right here. We're at 3.5 million pop ups. That's all we do. Pop ups equals Alia Ali equals pop ups. So now when people see this, I pinned it to my profile. If someone wants to look me up, this is the first thing they're going to see. And then this association sticks in their head. And that's where you create inbound demand and that's where you scale up business. The third is sales calls. Right when you're on a sales calls, I hop on a call and say, hey, I'm Sean, I'm the CEO. We do pop ups. That's how I start my calls. Right away when you hop on the call, it's like, hey, I'm Sean. We do pop ups and we care about pop ups. And they're like, okay, cool, thanks. Like, that's helpful context. They know what they're here for. Fourth is internal language. Very, very important, Right? Everyone on the team needs to understand that we were a company before, we are still this company, but we focus on this new thing so that when they're doing cs, when they're doing sales, when management is making decisions, they can speak the same language that you speak to yourself. There's different tweets and Slack channels where people ask what' the best pop up tool? And if you have that connection between yourself and that specific thing, every single reply is going to be use Alia or use whatever your company is because they know that you do that thing.",

      "text": "All right, before we get back to Sean's story about how he grew this business to 4 million. ARR. We got to talk about what comes first. Sean obviously didn't start with this brilliant strategy. Him and his co founders learned this on the fly while building, marketing, and talking to customers. But here's the thing. None of these things can happen until you have an idea that you're excited about. And this is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build.

If you're ready to build your idea, just head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, let's get back to the story. You had built this company. You had two customers. You're seeing other people online that have hundreds or thousands of customers. There's probably some uncertainty, something there. How did that feel in that. In that moment where you didn't have it figured out yet?",

And they ended up figuring it out. The way that I was able to set goals for myself was very simple. We had two customers. My only goal was to get a third. Once we got a third, my goal was to get a fourth, the fifth, so on. So that when you get to three customers, like, oh, wow, I got a new customer and you're not like, damn, this company has 20,000 customers. How will I ever get there? It's not your job to get there right away. It's your job to get to a third, to get to a fourth, to get to a fifth, and understand how you got to those five. Take those learnings and then get your next five, your next ten, your next hundred, your next thousand.",

I think some people who might be in a similar position are worried as what happens when I go too small, you know, niche down to a small feature, or I cut out potentially other useful things of my product. Tell me about in that moment. Was it scary to go and just decide, hey, I'm going to just reposition the entire company. How did you get the courage to do that?",

It was, let's hop on a sales call, let's talk about pop ups. Let's say we're a pop up tool and let's see what the close rate looks like. I noticed very quickly on the calls they were shorter, they were more succinct and they closed more often. So, okay, sales calls are going well. Now let's try to make some content around it. And that content did better than our previous calls. Content, okay, that's kind of interesting. Then we changed the website, then we did the internal language and then everyone was like, oh, okay, this makes sense. Let's flip everything now.",

The second activity is do the positioning activities that they say so in the book. They're like, ask yourself these questions. And you should ask yourself those questions. If you have a team, if you have co founders, do it with your co founders. Third is try the positioning out on sales calls and see the live reaction of those customers. See if those close more often, see if they understand the product better and see if they're more excited about it. If you do those three, you will have a good sense of, okay, is this new position a better position? Even if it isn't, you can go back to step two, talk to your co founders again, go through those questions again and maybe thinking about a new position that's going to be better.",

When you're a younger founder, the one currency you have that the incumbents of your industry don't have is speed and urgency. When it comes to the incumbents, they can't move as quick as you. So when we chose to reposition ourselves, we're now in an industry where folks have been there for 15, 20 years and they're going to move slower than us inherently because they're a larger company.
