I was just working with some local clients in Kazakhstan. I got a couple of small clients on local websites. I was slightly, slightly getting more experience and slightly growing. Right then in the January of 2024 I decided to open my X account for the first time and started posting consistently. A few months passed by, I got like 5 to 6k followers and in November of 2024 I opened my agency. So on average I think we juggle between six to seven clients a month. Some of them are one off products, some of them are retailers and I would say our average price for retailers is about 20k a month.",

So I decided to make like a new like campaign where I would do the free redesigns for these big brands. And WOP was the first one that I did. I took the landing page, redesigned the hero section and made a post about that. And the post blew up to like 110k views, I think like overnight, even though WOP itself didn't notice me. But at this time I got around of 10 to 12 call bookings overnight and closed majority of them. So it basically was my first month of running an agency and making this new campaign and it turned out super good.",

I also met with the boat team and I show it to them and they reached out to me maybe like in a week and we started working together. And here's another example of the free work we've done. We did a redesign for the homepage of acquisition.com and then Alex Hormozzi himself, he noticed this, right? And he actually responded to this tweet and this post. I would say it's probably the highest conversing post of my life. Maybe broke, maybe like 15, 16 call bookings every night.",

I'd love if you shared your playbook for getting early audience, getting those first few thousand followers, if you're doing anything in design or really anything in marketing online.",

      "text": "So step one, to start using this free work strategy, you first of all need to have an X account. So you need to get some followers, spend a lot of time engaging with other people in your niche. I was just leaving like 50 comments a day on other designers post. Step two, you go from with amount of followers like a few hundred followers to a few thousand followers by doing giveaways. The three things you can give away is usually the knowledge, the product or the service. So thing is, you basically say like to get this, you need to follow me, you need to leave a comment, you need to repost, right? And then I will send it to you like in the DMs. And basically because of the giveaways, I was able to go maybe like from 500 followers to 5k followers in a couple of months by doing maybe like three giveaways in total. Step three, I would say would be to download the tweet Hunter extension. You needed to see the most viral content of people in your niche, so then you can replicate that. Step four will be to experiment as much with the content as you can. Because the thing is, 3 to 5k followers is actually the best range of followers you can have. Why? Because you are big enough to make some of your content blow up, right? And you're not big enough for people to care about you enough. So you can like make like a bunch of posts and just like test new ideas, test everything you have in mind. And let's say if it's not good enough, then people just will not notice that it doesn't matter. You will not hurt your reputation. And if it's good enough, then it will blow up. And step five would be to make something cool for these big ass brands. How it works is that you find the most viral brands people talk about right now. So right now it may be clearly. So every month, every couple of months, people have something new to talk about. And your idea is to spend as much time to make the highest quality of work for this trending brand name to then make it go viral.",

He had a system for creating stunning designs quickly, which is the same idea behind the app Maubin, our sponsor of today's video. Maubin is one of my favorite tools for finding amazing design inspiration. It's a giant vault of real product designs from the best apps in the world, actual apps and screens broken down by features and styles. So instead of guessing how to design your app, you can just find proven templates and build from that 10 times faster. This app has saved me hours and it makes designing fun again. So if you're interested, check out Maubin at the first link in the description. Huge thanks to Maubin for supporting this video and sponsoring the channel. All right, let's get back to the story. Okay. Thank you for sharing that playbook. I think it's awesome. Can you share some more numbers behind the business and how it's doing just 10 months after starting? Yeah.",
