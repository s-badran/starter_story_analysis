Let me post it here. So I put a link in here and I say, hey, try it out. Give me some feedback. What do you think? Is this useful to you? And you can see, like, people make literally lists that they tell me, no, do this, do this. I've been waiting for such an app, and because there's no price attached to it on the website, it's also not. He just wants to have our money. It works really well.

If I would have used new, unknown technologies, I would have had to learn them, understand them, find out they have limitations I didn't know before. And it was good because I could ship my MVP in three days and then build upon it slowly and comfortably in the one hour that I had in the evening, instead of building on it for three months just to have something that is usable. And then, because it was a side business, a side project, it took me 224 days to actually get my first dollar. And that's totally okay. It grew from there.",

You know, why don't you learn marketing and take over these parts of the business? And she was really excited about it, and she really learned quickly. And now she. She does Google Ads, she does all the sales emails, she does all the customer support emails. And we have an amazing support. People are really happy with it. And I do the product, the finances, the development, and kind of the overall direction. Right. Like CEO work. And sometimes we walk over the street and talk about how we grow stage time, or sometimes we just look at any business, like, how would you grow this shoe business over there?

My father really wanted me to have a paper so I did. At the same time I start freelancing, I wanted to know how it is to have your own business. As a developer, I get into a startup Once I'm done 2020, I have my degree but already my mind is like how can I build my own product right? So soon later I just start tinkering on this thing. So shortly after November 2020, right as Corona was hitting first commit for stage time, that was when I built the mvp. And then a few days later I post this post on Reddit and by 2022 my wife encouraged me, hey, why don't you quit? Because Stagetime was already making enough money to just get by 3,000amonth. So I did quit. Thanks to her. I probably would have been much longer in the job if it wouldn't have been for my wife.

Distribution is everything. You can build the best tool in the world, but if nobody sees it, it doesn't matter. That's why we're excited to partner with the Monday.com app marketplace. Monday.com has over 245,000 customers using the platform across 200/ Industries, from HR and IT to operations and event planning. And here's the kicker. 90% of enterprise accounts use Monday.com apps. In other words, there's massive built in demand and unlike other platforms, it's not overcrowded yet. It's a great time to get in. This is the perfect moment for solopreneurs to get in early, build niche tools, and solve real user pain points. Even better, Monday.com gives you everything you need to succeed. Robust APIs, flexible SDKs, detailed docs, and in a dev team that actually supports your growth. You build the app, set up your pricing and monetization is all built in. Billing, subscriptions, payment processing. It's all taken care of. We teamed up with Monday.com to create a free resource that breaks down exactly who their users are and where you might find your next winning idea. Click the first link in the description to grab it and take advantage of this opportunity. Thank you to Monday.com for sponsoring. Now let's get back into the video. Let's talk about how have you driven customers to your app to sign up and grown this thing to over 25,000 mrr.",

And we have done a lot of work that this is the case, right, that people want to talk about us or do inadvertently share our tool with others. So we have a niche tool, right? Very niche. A niche small enough that most big companies wouldn't really bother with it, but for us as solopreneurs, perfect. And I decided we will see if we can grab stuff that people are already doing in our niche and then combine our tool with it. So if you look for countdown timer, stream deck companions, we created a documentation page that shows very precisely how you use our tool. Together with this integration for this physical device, we also created a video and put it on YouTube. Or when you look in YouTube and you search for this video, it doesn't have many views. But the trick is the people that do search for this and the people that do look for this on YouTube, they want to have their question answered. Right? They have a concrete problem and they want to have a solution for it so they find you and they're so much more likely to purchase. So this is a super niche keyword. The way we find these keywords is we put up documentation, put up articles, and then we look with a sense for what do people actually click on and then double down.",

You know, Dropbox, you create it and then it says, oh, you want to have 5 gigabyte more space, you know, share the link with a friend, have them sign up. And I thought, how can I integrate this into my own app? It's called Product LED Growth. And I just made sure every single link that people share my logo is on it. And not only is my logo just like a picture, it has the name stagetimer IO in the logo. It's like literally written there. And it's a name easy enough to remember that people often just see it, even tell us, oh, I saw it on an event and I used it myself. That's the one way. And the other way is we make it a freemium model. By doing this, we capture a lot of freelancers that work in this space and they bring it along to the events that they're invited. And somebody says, ah, we need a timer. So they say, ah, let me just pull up stage time. When they pull it up it works so well. People are really excited. Eventually they want to use it for their next event, hit some kind of limit and say it's worth it, let's, let's purchase. It happens very often. So having a free tier works really well for us.",

It's like a big Excel sheet with all our customers in it. But what you can do is you can do automations on top of that. And then on top of this, we use a postmark to actually send out emails. I'm a big fan of Postmark. It's like an email sending platform, but really made for solopreneurs. So these are really the bread and butter tools that I'm using for Stage Timer.",

I think that anybody can take lessons from his story and build a SaaS, build a cool app, get users, and potentially start even getting paying customers. So if you're interested in building something similar apps and simple projects, then you should definitely check out Starter Story Build. In Starter Story Build, we show you how to find an idea, how to build it with AI tools and how to actually ship it into the real world and get users and potentially build something that changes your life. What's even cooler is that you'll do it all in just 12 days. So if you've got that simple idea or you want to find it, maybe turn it into a great business, head to the link in the description to check out Starter Story Build.
