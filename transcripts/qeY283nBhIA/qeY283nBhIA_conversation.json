That now makes me $3,000 a month in monthly recurring revenue and it's made me over $60,000 in the last year. The second thing I built was a social media scheduling tool called PostBridge.

It sounds dramatic, but I would often tell my friends and myself that I would rather be homeless than work a job. Basically I quit my job at McDonald's. I dropped out of school in the same few months to pursue a bunch of different businesses in three years, making a book, selling T shirts, having a crypto YouTube channel, many other things. I eventually landed on learning how to code. I kind of just went into it head on. The first thing I went to build was actually Curiosity Quench. Everything broke almost every single time I built it. I just kept putting errors after errors into ChatGPT and eventually I had a working product, but it didn't go like skyrocket growth right away. I still had to keep working on it and find new angles on how to market it, how to get into people's hands. So that was still an ongoing process for many months, even after I built it.",

I just point and shoot, recorded it talking to the camera and 15 people commented saying, I need this. This is it, this is good. So I kept making videos.

But before we get into the growth, I do want to talk about about one very important thing that you cannot forget to do before you launch analytics. And yes, this is today's sponsor, but I'm actually kind of nerding out right now because this is one of my favorite tools and I actually use it every day. And I'm going to show you right now how I use it. So this is posthog and by the way, how freaking cool is their website with this crazy dinosaur thing. But you can install it on your site with just one line of code and they have a really generous free plan. Once it's installed, you'll get product analytics, session replay, experiments, surveys and more. But my personal favorite feature is AB testing. And I'm going to show you a starter story, a B test in Posthog right now that increased our conversion rate by over 300%. Check this out right here. This is crazy. And why I really recommend using Post Hog. But what I think is also cool is that in posthog you can track the A B test going through the funnel and see how this A B test affects affects the entire conversion flow. You can also even drill down Further and look at conversion rates by source. So I can see how people convert from Twitter, YouTube, ChatGPT and a bunch of other places. These A B tests are so important for our business and there's just really not another tool that can actually do this. So if you want to install posthog, which I think you should do, and it's free, just click the first link in the description and tell them you came from starter story. All right, now back to the video. All right, let's talk about your specialty. Let's talk about marketing. How do you actually get users to these businesses and have them pay money?",

Was just finding a template that I can repeat over and over and over again. A very funny, simple two by two images caption template. It's six seconds long and having the pinned comment B, go download and try our app. And then I would make a mistake even to drive engagement in the comments like astrology and astronomy. If you get those mixed up, people are really going to get angry. Originally, I created my templates by just making a cap cut project and copying pasting it over. Eventually this became a bit too slow, so I actually built in like a template creator into my sass, which is postbridge. I posted the two by two template over now 300 times on two different accounts, and they've driven 60 to 70,000 signups just through these simple templates that have brought in like hundreds of millions of views.",

First, I would Open account on TikTok and Instagram for my product or a personal page. Either one works. And I would just scroll on those pages for two days, 15 minutes a day each. This is to warm it up so the algorithms don't think you're a bot. You're a real human being. While you're doing this, when you see videos that have went viral, save them. Do not post content during this time. Comment and follow people in your niche. So interact with posts and then after you've warmed up your account, download capcut. It's super easy. You can learn it in an hour and you can Start posting videos from proven examples that you've seen. You spin them with your app, either as a call to action at the end of the video, three seconds or less, or don't even put in the video. Make your caption and your first comment a call to action to go to your thing. The algorithm loves watch time. And the easiest way to get like 100%, 200% watch time is to make your video six seconds long. But what matters more than all that is to make content that people actually watch. It has to provide some type of value, some type of connection, some type of laugh. It could be entertainment, it could be education. But if it's directly an ad, people are going to scroll. It's not going to work. So once you find a winning format, double down on it. Just recreate that video in a different way and post it over and over again. Milk it till it's dry.",

For me, it was building an app. For many other people it might be something like writing a book or doing something even around their house, like organizing stuff a certain way. But most people aren't sharing the things they're doing in their lives. They're sharing like aphorisms and quotes that no one really cares about.

It can skip it, but it just offers them a trial for the premium version. And obviously most of the great things about my app are behind that paywall. Also, in mobile apps, what's really important is onboarding. Basically, before you get to showing that paywall for them to pay, tell them what the problem you're solving is and how you're going to solve it. Make them get excited about it because they're going to be way more primed to actually spend money on your thing when they know it's going to help them. For web, for Postbridge, my SaaS, I did experiment a lot with yearly pricing. But what worked even better for me was a seven day free trial. There's no free version. You Just put your credit card in if you want to try it, you can cancel any time. That was really helpful for me.
