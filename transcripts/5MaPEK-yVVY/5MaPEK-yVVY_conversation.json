When you're trying to get your first hundred subscribers, your first thousand subscribers, you do the things that aren't. You can't really sc and so you're reaching out to people, telling that you have a newsletter, right? You're DMing people on LinkedIn, you're DMing people on Twitter, Instagram, you're getting friends to push it. You're doing little giveaways. Like you're finding this small things that adds 10 subscribers, 15 subscribers. Right. Second thing I would do is what we call it's like buffet marketing. The idea of like you walk in a golden corral and you see all this food. You're like, man, I got 20 bucks and I got all this food right now I'm about to get all these plates and I'm going to try all this shit. And then what I like I'm going to go back for. Then it's like what has the potential to 10x finding those things that have the 10x potential and then honing in on like the one or two things that always are driving growth. If I was trying to start from scratch again, I would start first with hand to hand combat, then buffet marketing, then I would optimize scale and continue refining it.",

So now how do I get people to want to pay money to get in front of that group? The other way is a paid newsletter. I don't know if you're familiar with Lenny's newsletter. That is another great way of monetizing your newsletter where he has the free newsletter that works as top of funnel for his paid newsletter that he charges I think like 899 or like 1099 for or it's more exclusive content.

So being able to use Twitter threads and segue people to the newsletter. The second one has been paid acquisition. So that's running Facebook ads, Instagram ads, TikTok ads, Reddit, like all, you know, testing all the different acquisition channels. I'll try all sorts of different CTAs on my Twitter threads. Whatever works there is then the basis for a lot of things I'll do on pace. And then the third is this is new where it's a lot of platforms like Sparkloop, a lot of platforms like Beehive are now in Convertkit. They gave you a scalable way of having cross promotions.
