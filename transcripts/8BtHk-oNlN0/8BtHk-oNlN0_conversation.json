One, find an app that's working and two, make it 1% better if it's already successful. I know it's validating, but don't be fooled. He's not just copying and pasting. And in this episode, he breaks down his meticulous method for finding winning ideas and turning them into successful app. We'll get into where the best ideas are hiding in plain sight. How to validate fast so you don't waste months working on a failed project. And the playbook for researching and replicating successful apps that you can put into practice today. All right, let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome, Samuel, to the channel. Thanks for coming on. Tell me about who you are and what's your story?",

I wanted to rebuild a tool I was using for Instagram, but this time I wanted to build it myself using code. I ended up following a 15 hour course on YouTube and every time I learned something new in the course, I immediately tried to apply it to that tool I was building. So if you just watch a course, most of the time it's not enough because you end up losing yourself in the languages that you will probably never use and you don't really see why you are learning what you are learning. But yeah, it all starting like this, following a YouTube course, and it quickly became a passion for me.",

And with AI today, you can literally build like 90% of most apps. So my framework today would be one, pick a real project. Two, ask ChatGPT what you need to learn to build it. So for example, you go on Google or on Twitter and you find the product you like and you take a screenshot of that page and you ask ChatGPT how can I build just the landing page to start. And three, build step by step asking ChatGPT for help at each roadblock. I would of course ask him to use modern technologies like Next js, Node js.",

So I have one rule that is really crucial for me is to never build something that doesn't already exist and isn't already successful or at least getting some traction. So this way I reduce my chance of failure and I increase my chances of success. So usually to find products, ideas, my number one source of idea is Twitter, especially around communities like Solopreneur, indie hacker, building public, etc. And then I look for things that are working or products that I personally like. Here are my four keys filter. Number one, I would use it myself. Number two, I can see that it already works. And three, they are not spending thousand on marketing, meaning there is a true demand. And four, the product is simple enough to maintain. If your product passes this filter, then usually I'm confident it was building it.",

      "text": "So first, the most important thing I look for traction. The best signal you can find on Twitter is when founders share their MRL screenshot or stripe screenshot. I know that sounds basic, but honestly it's the ultimate proof that the tool is working and that people are paying for it. Second, I analyze how they are getting their customers. So I use Ahref to check their traffic sources. So are they getting customers only from ads or are they also ranking on SEO? If they are growing with both ads and SEO, that's a better good sign because it shows a strong demand and it's usually easier to replicate their success if they rely mostly on SEO. It can be harder because SEO takes time, but it's still doable. If I'm Patient. And third, I check if the product is technically something I can build and maintain easily. I don't want to build a product that will make me lose sleep maintaining a complex backend. Simplicity is very important for me. And finally, I ask myself, do I actually like the product? Because there's nothing worse than working on a project you don't care about. If I don't enjoy using it myself, I won't have the motivation to keep going long term. So in short traction, first analyze traffic sources, check if I can build it easily, and make sure I like the product.",

    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "So actually the first real app I built was User Themis. And at that time I didn't use that strategy and it was a mistake because I ended up building an email finding tool that have for competitors, big names like Apollo, Lemlist and stuff like that. And it was so difficult to maintain. So after use Artemis, I really decided to build something that will be easier to maintain. And that's how I end up building storyshorts. So I saw a post from a guy building a tool to automate posting faceless video on YouTube, TikTok, etc. And the numbers were crazy. So I started to investigate is it hard to build? And where is the traffic coming from? The really good thing with this one is all the traffic was from Facebook ads, which means I can replicate it literally in a week. Because Facebook ads, you just have to start it and you have the traffic. So I went for it. I built the tool, launched ads, and story short AI grew very fast. So with story short it was 100% the process I described earlier. I validated the idea. I saw there a clear demand. It was simple product and it was a market I was personally interested in.",

You've got a working idea, you know it solves a problem. But suddenly you've wasted hours taking screenshots just to figure out how to make your app look good. That' where Maubin comes in. Maubin is the world's largest library of real world, mobile and web app designs. Over 1.7 million people, from Airbnb designers to indie devs, use it to find inspiration, study flows, and build smarter, not slower. You can search thousands of actual product screens by keyword flow or even style. Whether you need an onboarding flow, paywall layout, or just a clean signup form, Maubin shows you exactly how the best apps do it so you don't have to start from scratch. Whether you're building your first app or your 10th, it's a massive time saver. Just click the first link in the description to check out Maubin. Thank you to Maubin for sponsoring this video. All right, let's get back to Samuel. All right, so I mean, on that note, can you break down the three different businesses that you built that are all successful?",

I have StoryShow AI, which is an AI video generator for TikTok and YouTube that is making around $20,000 per month and has around 4,000 customers and capacity. So which is brand new. It's an AI coding tool that is making currently $900 per month and has around 50 users.",

      "text": "So I always start by running ads. It's always the first thing I do. So I do it on Google and Meta, depending on the product. Sometimes it's better on Google, sometimes it's better on Meta. It's the fastest way to validate and test the market. And as soon as I get some traction with ads, I move to the second part of the growth, which is SEO. I think too many apps rely only on ads and never got a single visitor from Google. Of course, SEO takes time, but once it works, it's almost free traffic and it compounds. I also use faceless YouTube channels to grow my apps. I even created a feature insight storyshort for this. The idea is that storyshorts will automatically publish daily UGC style video about your product on YouTube channels, TikTok and Instagram. You can create multiple channels that talk about your product every day on Autopilot. So depending on your niche, this can bring crazy results over time. It works really well. And finally, I do affiliate marketing. I did it for all those three apps, especially on Story Short. It's super important because not only does it bring clients at a fixed cost, but it also creates variety because I have many people doing YouTube video about story short writing articles so it brings zero results and people are more likely to share your product is they earn a commission. So in short, my growth stack is 1 start with ads, 2 build SEO as soon as there's traction 3 use faceless YouTube channel to drive attention on also on TikTok and Instagram and 4 run an affiliate program to boost virality and get customers at a fixed price.",

Two would be spend time learning Google Ads and meta, even X ads and there are many ads you can learn. 3. Launch as soon as possible. Skip the boring parts of building a SaaS like the password, reset, pages, settings pages. Just launch the minimal basic products and run ads to test demand right away. Once you get traction, focus on SEO. It will bring compounding free traffic over time. And even if one day you want to sell the tool, having SEO traffic is also very valuable. And automate as much as you can use automation tools so like outrank, story, shorts, etc. To automate posting, article creation as much as you can. Finally, once you have growth and customers coming daily, I would finish the product, bring new feature, etc.",
