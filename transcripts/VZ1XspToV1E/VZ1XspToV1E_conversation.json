And I saw a video from him where he was making supposedly 10k a month doing rank and rent SEO. And so I started doing that, bought my first domain, started doing local SEO With Rank and Rent, got a couple of clients, then got a bit tired of dealing with clients. So I just took my SEO services and started selling them on Fiverr, Upwork and other marketplaces. But then I noticed that these marketplaces, they were missing a lot of things that I wanted to see in my own marketplace. And so I built my own SEO marketplace called Vetted. We sold it last year and the AI bubble was just coming. When I sold Vetted, I knew that I wanted to still build something in the SEO space, but now applying AI to it. And so we thought an AI writer could be a idea, so we built it. That's basically the whole story of how Arvo came about.",

All in all, I think YouTube has everything you need to have someone low, like and trust you and then buy from.

      "text": "So this was basically our playbook in three core steps. First one is you have to focus on producing money making assets. I just produce a bunch of long form content in basically three buckets. First bucket again is evergreen. So a video that I know that if I post today, it will still keep on getting views a year, two years from now. And we do have those videos. I'll give an example. We have a video on the best AI SEO writers. The second bucket is news relevant type videos that get a lot of views in the first two or three days and then die out. These are basically a new Google Update comes out. This is good to get a bunch of subs and a bunch of new eyeballs onto your channel, which then you can funnel into your products or services. Then the third is just sort of viral, like Mr. Beast, like videos, but applied to software, which is quite hard to do. Then we just do that over and over again. The issue with that is that I'm just one. So I'm sort of capped as to how many videos I can do. And so I say this to say that this goes into the second part of the strategy, which was how can I multiply myself? And so what I did then was I created a bunch of YouTube channels, Vasquez, SEO10, Tim, Seoguru, SEO News, whatever, and all these channels we owned. And so then I had to find creators because my goal was to have all the channels and post a creator in each one of those channels. The wrong way to go about finding creators is going and finding creators because they're very expensive and they have a big ego. And so what I did was let me find people who I think can become creators. So I went on upwork and I skimmed through people's profiles who, for example, had a video. Having a video on your upwork profile tells me that you're sort of comfortable in front of the camera. So I went and went after those guys. And so all in all, I had all these channels and I paid people per performance and I paid people per video. On top of that, why not expand to other languages? So we found Portuguese creators, we found Spanish ones, just like MrBeast does with these channels. After we've done step one and two, we want to focus on the third step, which is scaling and expanding. With paid ads, most of your videos graphs will look like this. They go up, get views, and then they stagnate and get no more views. And so what I've noticed was that when we were getting views, we were getting sales, and then when the views stagnated, we stopped getting sales. I didn't feel like recording the same video over and over again just to get those initial views. And I think that's where paid ads come in. On YouTube, you can run what's called in feed ads. These ads appear in two places. First one is on your YouTube homepage. And then when you're watching a video, it shows up on the right hand sidebar so it looked like organic pieces of content. I took the videos who performed well, who got views, got sales, and then stagnated. And I paid YouTube for in feed ads. The issue with YouTube and YouTube ads as well is that it's very hard to track to track YouTube organic. What we've done is three things. First one again is have a dedicated UTM in each video. If maybe 1% of people click the links in the description, you know that they came from that video. Something else we did to increase the tracking accuracy was have a dedicated coupon in each video. I would say something like, hey guys, if you want to check out arvo, go to arvo.com and by the way, if you want a coupon code, just click the little chat bubble at the bottom and ask the guys from support saying hey, Vasco told me I can get a coupon code. I came from this video. Give me a coupon code. And third thing, if you go onto Arbor right now, if you sign up, we have like a welcome questionnaire where if you select you came from YouTube, a bunch of our channels faces pop up so you can choose which creator you came from. When I mentioned about scaling with paid ads, you have to be careful because you never know if you're not promoting a video that's not bringing in many sales. Two extra tips on CTAs. Before I was doing the call to action at the end of the video and that doesn't make any sense because most people don't watch all the way through. So just a simple fact of moving the CTA towards the beginning and middle of the video just increased our numbers of signups by a lot. Second thing is don't just make generic call to actions like yeah, just go check out the website. What we've been doing is we create specific call to actions. So we make them sort of interactive, not just a generic one and prompting them to do an action inside of the site. That's it.",

      "text": "I think your strategy is really smart. You build this awesome tool and then you use YouTube to grow the business. But it still reminds me, you can't make YouTube videos about a product that doesn't exist. If you watching this don't have something built yet, all the content strategy in the world won't help you. And this is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. It's our flagship program where you will learn how to build and launch your project using AI coding tools. In just a couple weeks, you'll get access to our build experts, you'll join thousands of other builders and you'll learn our complete framework for building and shipping apps. Once you have something built, then you can go start creating YouTube videos just like Vasco did. So if you're ready to build, just head to the first link in the description to check out starter story build. All right, Basco, let's get to the next question. I would love if you could actually show me a real example from your YouTube channels for your business. Can you show me a YouTube video that kind of changed your business?",

      "text": "Yeah, sure. I guess this is the very first one where I realized the power of YouTube, which again, this was posted I think two years ago. It's a video on how to make a Wikipedia page. It's a very bad tutorial, but still till this day it gets 1.2 million impressions. I think around 300 views every single day. 65% of traffic comes from YouTube search. How to create a Wikipedia page. How to make a Wikipedia page. 20% of traffic comes from Google search. Not only does the video rank on YouTube, it also ranks on Google. And I can go on to the LLM type of things because nowadays we see a bunch of our views being recommended in these LLMs. So if I could give any tips is to, yes, build out these evergreen videos. Granted though, it's very important to know that mix up these evergreen ones with sharing case studies, sharing news, just produce valuable content and know that there's some chance that those videos can become evergreen in the long run.",

It's very difficult that you do something a lot of times for a long period of time and you don't see success. So for YouTube, what I advise is okay, just post a video every single day for 45 days. Most people will watch this and won't do it. The rest of the people will try to do it and will stop after a week. Maybe like one or two people out of all else will actually do it. And those who do it will actually see success. If any viewer is watching this and does a video on YouTube for 45 days, if they don't make at least $5,000, I'll just PayPal you $500. By the way, don't think that you need to have these very polished videos, right?
