This is as soon as you see something is kind of getting interesting and you want to branch off or create a different kind of fork in that conversation, you could do that by creating a new note.

Each one of those had different kind of expertise. Cloud was much better for coding and GPT was much better for high level architectural kind of things. And Perplexity was much better for real time information. So the UX designer in me thought, okay, this is a frictionless experience and this is kind of broken. And if it's, it's going to be much better if I can do it all in one tab. And it kind of evolved as a design from there.",

So that's where I went with initially and launched a web app with free trial where you get like a few questions for free and then you have to pay after a little bit of usage. But that didn't get much traction. And I feel like there's multiple reasons to that. The top ones are that I did not have a huge personal brand trying to do the build in public thing where I was talking on Twitter or kind of posting everywhere where I got a chance. I got some interest, but never really turned into any real dollars. And on top of it, I kind of decided that my ideal customer profile, icp is a power AI user. So at that point my ICP would already be saturated with bunch of different subscriptions. They were paying for these multiple AI models. So that's when I had to change the product a little bit by moving away from web app into a desktop app and making it a one time purchase.",

I wanted to start with a one time purchase and I had to convert the app into a one time purchase, which means that I cannot incur any AI cost because AI usage cost me money. And I wanted to offload that to the users. So that was step one to make it bring your own keys. And the second step was to not even incur any server cost. If I were to like just build it once and sell it many times. I had to offload my server Cost to the users as well. And the easiest way to do that was to just use the user's computers. And to do that I had to build a desktop app. This allows me to like ship and forget about my business cost. And everything ran on the users. They paid for the AI. As soon as they changed it, a lot of people actually started paying. They were more serious in terms of giving feedback. Felt much more refreshing in the sense that people were not only more serious, but they were also more helpful and kind of like believing in this early stage product. So after we moved to a one time purchase model, that change led to about $80,000 in the last six months.",

But I think a VC style of doing freemium would not work for a bootstrap model. Having venture capital would actually mean that you can offset your truth seeking in a sense. Like you can kind of delay your product market fit. So you can kind of hope that people would come on board. But that's not a luxury that bootstrap businesses would have. So almost every bootstrap business should do a lifetime deal along with whatever they are doing. If you already have like a subscription model, have a lifetime deal. Even if it's a limited thing, have it because it kind of gives you this boost in morale with this chunk of cash coming in and you have a much more validated idea and you have a good sizable user base who are willing to actively give feedback and be involved. And it's hugely, hugely beneficial if you're solo founder or like a founder with like a small team trying to figure out what to build. Because usually what happens, which happened with me in the past as well, was that you kind of get into your own head and trying to think what to build and what not to build.",

Making money online isn't as complicated as most people think. At its core, it's as simple as creating something valuable and putting a stripe payment link on it. No, it won't always work, but you'll never know unless you ship it. And that's the beauty of the Internet today. There are almost no barriers to trying. And this is why we created Starter Story Build. It's our action oriented bootcamp where in just a couple of weeks you'll come up with an idea, you'll build it with AI tools and you'll actually launch it to the real world. Even if you have no coding experience or you're still working a full time job job, there has never been a better time to just try. So if you're ready to take action, click the first link in the description to learn more about Starter Story Build. All right, now back to Praneeth Story. The next question I have is more specific and tactical is the pricing of lifetime deal. How did you price your lifetime deal and how would you recommend anybody who's got similar products to price a lifetime deal?",

      "text": "If you are building an AI product, I think it's absolutely worth it to have a bring your own keys model that offsets a lot of costs and it kind of offloads a it from you to the user. So everybody should do that. The way I've done that for rabbit holes is that the pricing of the actual product actually started with something really small. I started off with $29 when I was under 100 users. Once it crossed 100, I bumped it to like 49. And we are going to be bumping the lifetime deal much higher and kind of moving on to a recurring model now that we are about 1200 users right now. So the initial offering was much lower and the early users who bought in got in a much better deal. And it also gave me feedback of like that the wanting to buy something like this.",

So my landing page copy was like completely tailored to AI users. I call them out in my H1 and I call them out in multiple places on my website. And this is very important. And there's like tons of places where you can find how to structure Your website. And after I've done that, I started like talking more about it on Twitter and I kind of like replied to conversations that were in relation to AI interactions and the new age of AI. And it was not just directly talking about my product in a sense, like you know, buying a product or I'm building this in that sense, but I was just hinting towards something related to my product.",

But another big thing I have to talk about or touch on is the AI SDK that is built by people at Vercel. And it's a huge accelerant in me being able to build this product because it allowed me to build a product with great abstraction where I could just focus on the front end and have almost nothing to worry about integrating with this multiple different kind of AI providers. AI SDK gives you the best abstraction in that sense. You use it and you're automatically capable of plugging into all the top providers and the some.",
