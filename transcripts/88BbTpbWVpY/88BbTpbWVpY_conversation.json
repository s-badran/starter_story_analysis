A 10 minute call could easily cost you between 50 and $100, depending on your country and provider. Yadaphone solves this problem by using the voice over IP technology. That means that you can call Any mobile or lend a number for cents. Our clients are travelers, expats or just in general businesses that need to make a lot of calls. Yadaphone is a pay as you go international calling service and that really us from most of the other competitors out there because the others operate on a SaaS model. That means that if you are an individual customer, you need to buy subscription that usually costs $30 a month or more. And if you're a business, you need to buy a seat or a subscription for each of the members of your organization. We allow businesses to just purchase a certain number of credits and then all of the organization members of this business can just use this central balance to make calls. Whenever you run out of credits, you can just top them up and that's it.",

Then I actually started working at the company and I realized that this is not the thing for me. I want to have my own startup instead of working at somebody else's company. I started to do freelancing to support myself. At any given moment I was working on something on the site. And my first projects, they were ugly. They had no users. Then slowly, with each of them, with each of my projects, I learned one thing or the other. My design started to be better, my code started to be more reliable. With each of the projects I just learned something new and eventually it all piled up into this set of skills that ultimately let me build the other phone.",

And then in March 2025, Microsoft announced that they were closing it down. Then I saw a tweet by Peter Levels saying that he and his friends were also using Skype, and he was quite pissed that Microsoft was closing it down. He encouraged people publicly to build a Skype alternative. And I thought, why not me? Turns out I'm not the only person using Skype to make international calls, which I didn't know. And then I just built a quick prototype over the weekend. I launched it on Reddit and X and got my first sales in minutes, which never happened to me before in any of my previous projects.",

And this is proof that when you actually learn to build in ship, your life can change in just one weekend. And this is exactly what we do. Inside Starter Story Build. It's our program where you will learn how to build and launch your project using AI coding tools in just a couple weeks. The best part is that you don't even need to know how to code. You can just show up, follow our building framework, and finally ship that idea to the world. Our next AI build bootcamp is starting this week, so if you are ready to build, head to the first link in the description to claim your spot. All right, let's get back to the interview. Okay, so you mentioned that you launched this and you got users overnight. That's obviously not the case for a lot of people watching this. They probably built stuff and that didn't happen.

And the thing about Reddit is that you can get millions of impressions without having any followers at all. I launched products on it before. I got blocked a lot, but I knew how to write stuff up, which subs to target, which tone of voice to use. So I decided to launch primarily on Reddit. My first post was just screenshots of the core functionality of my app, which I think really made it stand out. It was a very simple and clean web dialer interface and a couple of sentences about the product. I wrote to the subreddits for travelers because I thought that this is my main core audience. I got blocked there really fast and it was quite demotivating. But before I got blocked, I had enough time for the users to see my post. The most crazy thing is that I got the first sales minutes after my first Reddit post. I've never seen anything like that before. And that was a clear sign that my idea was validated. Then I started posting regularly on subreddits for entrepreneurs. A very good thing about entrepreneur subreddits is that there you can first of all showcase your project, promote your project yourself, and you can also post links to your projects and you don't get blocked for this. In the first week, I got 150 users.",

It's a validated market, which was first validated with the tweet by Peter Levels I saw and then by sales I got from my Reddit post. And apart from that, it was a combination of a very good timing because at the time Microsoft MiSoft announced it was closing Skype down, people started looking for alternatives and that created a lot of virality around all posts that were connected with this kind of big news event. And the third component is that I just had enough skills at that point that I could create something that looked good, solved a real problem, and people are willing to pay for it.",

      "text": "I would say that the first step is find the market where your competitors are dinosaurs. They are old fashioned and slow moving. Yadaphone is not the only app on the market that's offering international calling. I have competitors and they've been on this market for 20 some cases or 30 years. But the thing is that those kind of companies are very slow to change and to adapt to changing market conditions. Those markets have validated demand and you can get usability and design really fast better than those old fashioned competitors. Step 2 Build your MVP really fast and start posting about it everywhere on X, Reddit, LinkedIn, whatever social media you can find. Your MVP doesn't have to be perfect. Try to nail design and usability. Make sure that your core feature works well in the case of the other phone that was plainly making an outbound call from the app and make sure you have a compelling story to tell. This is especially important for Reddit because people there are really fast to scroll and they will disregard stuff that's not interesting for them. My story was of a lone engineer that was standing up to take the place of a giant company. Step three When a big competitor leaves, they have a lot of articles still mentioning them and this is a great chance to rank on keywords that you would otherwise never have a chance to rank for. Without a high domain authority website, people think you need to be a big established company to get mentioned in high authority blog posts and articles. But this is just not true. My process was like this and it's really simple. I looked for the keywords that I wanted to rank on, like for example Skype Alternative. Then I found the blog posts that were ranking there and tried to find the authors of those blog posts. Sometimes it was X, sometimes LinkedIn, sometimes email, but I just wrote directly to the authors asking whether they could mention yadaphone. They either agreed to add my tool to their blog post or just replace Skype with the other phone altogether. And this felt crazy because Vodafone replaced a giant, well established brand name and that obviously draw a lot of traffic to my website. Step 4 Keep iterating I used to text every single paying customer for six months asking for feedback. I just said hey, I'm Dennis, the founder of yadaphone. I would be thrilled to know what you think about the app and how your experience was so far. This is time consuming and you don't always have the energy as a founder for it, but this is immensely helpful because it helps you figure out what are your user segments and who your app is serving the best. And also it's catching the bad reviews early and you have the chance to react to bad experiences with your app before people go and give you bad reviews. Step 5 Create a B2B app as soon as possible Enterprise has bigger checks and much lower churn When I started with Yadaphone I thought it would be a pure B2C app for travelers and expats to call abroad. I created my enterprise plan totally by accident. A guy texted me in the middle of the night asking if Yadafone has an enterprise plan for his organization. I said of course we do and to tell you secret but didn't I coded my enterprise plan in a panic mode through the night because the next morning I had to live demo it in front of this customer. By the way, he is still a Yellowphone customer paying around $1,000 for it each month. So yeah, that would be my playbook if I was starting today.",

Days SEO changes take weeks, sometimes even months, but it pays off immensely. My competitors started ranking better for the keywords I targeted. Even though I was first to the market, I looked at the SEO, chatted a lot with ChatGPT about it and then it turns out it was a very small, stupid detail. My SiteMap didn't have a 3W prefix and Google just ignored all the pages I wanted to rank. So you have to be very attentive to details with SEO.",
