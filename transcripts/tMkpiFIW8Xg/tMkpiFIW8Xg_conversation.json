So we're serving this market of people that want to learn back end technologies and just aren't finding the resources because front end is so dominant in the online learning space. The next differentiator was you should make your thing feel totally different, totally unique. I really was inspired by Seth Godin's book, the Purple Cow. Fantastic marketing book. But the basic idea is when someone lands on your site, as a new entrepreneur, it can be really tempting to go look at a bunch of competitors websites and like, oh man, they're so beautiful. They're so well designed. I should make my website look like theirs. Absolutely. You should not do that.",

I've always wanted to get out of the nine to five employee work. The business Boot dev had just started making about $2,000 a month. So multiply that by 12, it's like 24K. Right. And then take into account any expenses. Like you're basically not making any money. So I'm talking with my wife about this. I'm like, you know, it's making 2k a month, like that's, that's not so bad. And I really like it and I feel like if I put more time into it, we could grow this thing. She was incredibly nervous about that idea because Obviously I'm earning 200k a month. We've got our second child on the way. She did not like the risk. Frankly, I didn't even really like the idea of taking that much risk. So as it happens, the CFO at the company I was working at went to go work with an ex CEO of mine. So a mutual friend and I went and pitched him and his partner on the idea of investing in Boot Dev. And so he gave me the angel funding. It was 330k, but it gave me enough of like assurance that, okay, we could at least have a couple of years of Runway to try this new business.",

And so it really just seemed to be that people getting into coding were gravitating towards the front end side and almost being pushed to the front end side by online learning platforms.

Because if you don't have a great solution, you're not going to break into the space, but you should tightly scope what you're building. I see this mistake all the time too. The idea of just packing on new features, solving different problems. You should only be listening to what problems your customers have, and then you should be filtering out any problems from customers that aren't exactly the type of customer that you want to serve. In my opinion, the most dangerous thing you can do is try to serve multiple customer Personas.",

They got this crazy dinosaur shooting flames right here. But for anyone that's launching anything and wants to track how their customers are using their product, you can install Posthog on your site with one line of code and they have a very generous free plan. So it's free to start and once it's installed, you'll have really good product analytics, web analytics session replay where you can see what people are actually doing on your website or in your product. They have AB testing, they got surveys, and they got more. One of my personal favorite features is the AB testing. And I'm going to show you an A B test for Starter Story right now in Post Hog. And this A B test increased our conversion rate by over 3,300%. You can see it right there. That's an insane number. And what I think is even cooler is that you can track the entire funnel of how this A B test affects the entire conversion flow. And you can see that right here. A B tests like these are super important to our business. And there's really just not like another tool that really can do it this well. So if you want to install Posthog, just click the first link in the description. You can install it for free. Just please let them know that you came from Starter Story. All right, back to the video. Let's get into how Lane grew this business, marketing and distribution. How did you get users to boot.dev and how did you grow this business?",

      "text": "So from 0 to about 2k a month, we really grew from my blog. It was great for finding people that were really interested in the product. And we did a ton of product development over those first year to 12 months. But then we weren't growing right. We were like, we started to feel a lot more confident in what we were building, but we just weren't getting enough people in the door for it to make sense as a business. And what we quickly found was that trust building, especially in the education space, is extremely important. So working with influencers was like a cheat code because the influencers are already trusted by their audience. So if you can get an influencer to try your thing and like it, you kind of unlock a new little section of the market because now their followers will naturally trust you a lot more. So then from 10k to 30k, we really grew a lot off the back of these free code Camp Collabs which was basically me recording an eight hour course, giving it to free code camp for free so they can publish it on their YouTube channel and us getting some exposure through that. So going from 30k up to where we're at now, which is almost a million a month, we had to scale what we were doing. Like I wasn't going to be able to create all this video content that was going to drive that amount of traffic. YouTube integrations, YouTube marketing, we've been able to scale that with other creators. And the unique kind of cheat code that we have as boot dev is that we have such strong affinity with a gaming audience. So we've actually done Most of our YouTube influencer marketing to gaming audiences rather than coding audiences.",

Hopefully you have some go ask them who they watch, right, who they listen to. This has been the best way for us to source new influencers to work with. Also if you're going to work with influencers, there's one giant exploit that you can take advantage of that doesn't work in most other channels, which is if you're incredibly easy to work with and you do a lot of work for the influencer, you can get better deals, you can shoot your own B roll for the influencer. There's a lot more room for arbitrage when doing one off deals with influencers. Do everything you can to make their life as easy as possible.",

You need the product to be good and you need to have confidence in the product before you spend a lot of time and money marketing the product. There's a minimal amount of marketing you do need to do to get some initial users to get product feedback. But in that first, you know, pre product market fit cycle, all your focus should be on the product and making the product solve the very specific problem for very specific person that you're trying to get it to solved.",

It worked. And I think the right business takeaway was let people really understand the product before we ask them to pay for it. It was resonating enough with them. So that's again comes back to the like you do need to spend all this time iterating on the product and making sure that you're actually solving the problem. And you need to be able to convince people that your product solves the problem before the purchasing decision happens.

For the marketing nerds out there, of course we use Post Hog for all of our product analytics and we use SendGrid for all of our email stuff.

I think that's absolutely the wrong way to approach business. The biggest, the biggest mistake is not taking action early, not starting a side project.
