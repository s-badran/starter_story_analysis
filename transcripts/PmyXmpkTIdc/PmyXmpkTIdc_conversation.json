And I was kind of like to lick my wounds. I was like, let me just kind of create apps and see how that goes. Luckily for myself was 2022 when GPT was first commercialized, so I was able to ride like loads of waves and learn a lot super quickly.",

It's kind of you ask questions, you get something back about the Bible and that wasn't really helpful. So I kind of flipped it to be more of an AI therapist, to be a little bit more emotional, ask questions after each response. Then launched on WhatsApp because again, I didn't have the technical skills right. So I used like a third party at the time. And then I didn't realize WhatsApp charges an arm and a leg per conversation window. Then my cost like ballooned to like 15k a month. I was like, hell no, I need to move on to my own infra. Then hired engineer from Upwork, but they moved it to like iOS and Android. And how I found the person that I sold it to was I actually first originally listed it on Microacquire. Then I was also active in my first million podcasts as well in a community they have on Facebook. And someone just happen to be in London at the same time that I also was. And he reached out, he was like, hey, this seems interesting. And then he ended up acquiring it.",

So I mean, by highly liquid, it means that right now tech isn't the hard thing to build at all. Which means there's a lot, lot more buyers out there who can feel like, hey, I can just take this product on and just market it better than you and then get more money and more profit margin. So I think that's the first thing number two came from a personal perspective. So I raised VC originally for my first startup, but I was still broke right at the end of the day. And with this, it was kind of a much clearer route to be able to get some cash in. And I think there's a lot of like dreams sold to people, which is kind of like, hey, raise VC. You know, raise, raise, raise for the next 10 years. And then, you know, hopefully there's that 0.0001% chance you're going to become a billion through there. I would rather, you know, build something and then in the 6 to 12 months, exit it for like a cool 250k.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "Okay, cool. A lot of people that watch this channel, they have this one big idea, they get really, really attached to this idea and they can't even imagine what would it be like to just build something just to sell it. How do you approach ideas? Do you get really attached to your ideas or how do you approach ideas?",

      "end": 303460
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Yeah. So for me, before I kind of start working on anything, I always tell myself, is this going to be my legacy or is this cash flow? And that then dictates further decisions going down the line. A lot of the things so far have been things that have just been cash flow. So that actually dictates on how I build things itself. What people normally get wrong is I'll take two main things. First one is that they make their apps way too complicated. And when I say complicated, I don't mean the actual app itself, but more so the operations behind the scenes. And they don't make it clean enough when you want to then get something acquired itself, which then normally like kills a lot of deals going forward. Especially if like, you know, a buyer is asking you certain questions and you can't answer it or just too long winded an answer, they just think, oh, you know what, this is not for me. So I think that's the first thing. The second of all, when they're also looking for buyers, I would say the issue is that everyone's good for the highest price. And the highest price tends to take the longest and also fall through the most itself. And the longer it takes, the more likelihood of it falling through. So even when I'm actually selling my app, I don't like to sell to the highest bidder. I normally like to sell to the third highest bidder and tell them that they have two other bids on top of them. But if they're able to close in like three to four days, I'll choose them. And they normally kind of like feel lucky and they're kind of like, you know what, let's just wire everything now and then let's get everything else sorted afterwards.",

Rocket lets you go from just a few sentences to a full stack app. Just describe your vision and in a few minutes you will get a complete, functional app. Backend integrations and production ready code everything. With Rocket New, you can import designs from Figma and integrate with Stripe and Supabase in just a few clicks. 400,000 users from around the world are building with Rocket because it's the simplest way to turn ideas into apps in minutes and not months. So if you're ready to finally build your idea faster than ever, check out Rocket at the first link in the description. Thank you to Rocket for sponsoring this video. I love what you guys are building. All right, let's get back to the video. Okay, cool. I want to get a little bit more tactical here. I want to understand your playbook. You've done this for over four apps. What is your actual playbook for? Finding an idea, building it, marketing it, and selling it. Can you walk me through this step by step?",
      "start": 376430,
      "end": 434210
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Yeah, for sure. So I'd say, like, step one is spotting trends in the App Store. And how you do that is actually pretty simple. You just essentially go to the App Store and be able to see, okay, who is currently number one in the different categories. And then once you do that, you're able to then see, are there other apps also, let's say in the top 20 who are doing exactly the same thing, but maybe for slightly different niches. Then I go to Sensor Tower to be able to see, okay, what's actually the revenue numbers of each. And if I see all of them are doing, you know, over 100k MRR or over 500k MRR, then I know, okay, cool, there's something here for sure. And once I've actually spotted the trend that I'm seeing, I didn't think to myself, okay, how can I make my app unique? So for me specifically, I love the Christian market itself, normally, because obviously I'm Christian myself. But also the edge is most technology gets to faith or religion last. And I want to be the one to kind of like pioneer that on the end. And then step number three, I would say, is make the app a single player. So Whenever I speak to people, a lot of people try to do this whole kind of socialness for the app where it's kind of, oh, you need somebody else to be able to come in for you to be able to get value. But I always say, like, make your app single player, something that someone could do on their own without having to invite anyone else in to get that initial value. Yes, you can do it afterwards as an added extra later on, but it just makes things too complicated. And then you kind of have to start marketing to two people at the same time. And then I would say number four, a key thing for me is like, is either you make it highly shareable and or super high retention. So no one on this earth shares apps, right? No one's gonna randomly be like, hey, yeah, download this app, right? But what they tend to do is actually share an asset within the app, so they don't even know that they share the app. A good case of this was magic music and I allowed people to share songs with other people and it opened up a web view where they could actually listen to the song without downloading the app. But I know the big green button that said create your own song. So what we kept seeing is that people would, you know, make a song about their friend cussing their friend, their friend listens to it and it's like, oh, you man, I'm create my own one. And then they then downloaded it themselves. And that actually made like the shareability of it, like super high. And then high retention. I mean, Praise Screen is the best one of saying this. So Praise screen had a 60% day 30 retention, which is kind of like unheard of. And what helped with that was two things. Number one, of course, we literally blocked your apps, so you kind of had to use us for you to unlock your apps. But also number two is something religious, so there's also another pull factor to bring people in. And then number five, I would say making the tech stack simple and plug and play. When you're trying to sell, sell something to someone else, you need to make it look as simple as possible just so that they don't need to come in with like technical know how per se to be able to operate this thing. Step six, I would say now you have kind of like your idea already. Now, of course, the major part is obviously growing it for it to be attractive to a buyer. I have a very specific route that I go down and it's normally UGC first. So I have multiple UGC accounts and I like to create content that is kind of rage baiting where it's kind of like you show something and people have to maybe scroll back or watch it again to just make sure that I just see that. Or they just end up arguing with everyone in the comments as well. Because all TikTok sees is that, oh, that's engagement. Let's boost that to other people. Once I have the right hook, then I then launch it on meta ads for example. And that way I actually get really low CPIs, CPI being cost per install. So for pray screen we were getting between 30 to 50 cents cost per install in the US market, which is like unheard of. That's actually how I normally grow things. Then number seven is around I guess the finale which is how to sell it for me. I love to get them to about 10k to 20k mrr before then looking for a buyer. One thing you want to do is that your last three months you want it to be like an uptick, right? You don't want it to be like, oh, it's currently failing and now you're trying to sell it because it just looks like you're trying to empty your bag to somebody else. Where I'd list it. Microcquire is a great place for you to list this. Also just posting on Twitter as well I've seen does really well in terms of valuations. They vary depending on the buyer. But I've seen between like 2 to 4x EBITDA. I would say EBITDA be just essentially profit, but again, the kind of apps I build aren't something that's like so deeply technological that another company would be like, well we need this for sure. It tends to be more of a cash flow thing for the other company that's purchasing, but normally between 2 to 4 x EBITDA for the ARR that you have.",

    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "Okay, cool. Well thanks for sharing that entire playbook. That was amazing. You've already built and sold four apps, so I imagine you see a lot of ideas that didn't work and obviously you've had some ideas that worked really well. If you were starting over today and building stuff, what would be some of the ideas you'd be working on right now? Apps that you think you could build and sell just like you've done.",
      "start": 689260,
      "end": 707290
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "First one sounds funny whenever I say it, but if you've been dating or have a girlfriend, you normally have this issue where they're kind of like, oh, you know, I've got a headache, I don't really feel well today. And you just find that they eat Three times a day I'll build an app where it just tracks that they've eaten three times a day. Especially like around let's say the 18 to 30 age group for sure. And the reason I'll do kind of this is because there's a specific audience so that means targeting is a lot easier. And then this is something I've already seen adjacent apps do which is more like, you know, calorie tracking specific women. So I'll just do some kind of version of that. Second idea I'll do would probably be something around Korean skin care thing that the ladies love again. I'll just make this kind of like tracker. You can take a picture of your face kind of like the looks maxing but just more specifically that the career glass skin. Just because there's already a big trend around it. People already spending real money on real procedures. So you already know the propensity to spend already is there. And then I call this chill guy AI but probably doesn't really make sense. So I always kind of thought, yo, there should be like an app where I can just type in stuff about my girlfriend, for example. And then it just reminds me and it just says, hey, you haven't had a date in, I don't know, three weeks. Here's a place. Just click this button to book or like you haven't sent flowers to her in like three months. I didn't have to think about it. Just click the button to book straight to her address, right? And like any little things she's told me before, I can just write it down in the kind of like journal. And then it just kind of uses that be able to find gifts. And I just click a button and it does it for me. And I just kind of think that would absolutely kill it, especially like revenue model wise. You can have the subscription based on that. So I think that's something that'll be super cool.",

There's also another product called app storetracker.com and that's able to be able to see different apps and how quickly they've gone up in the App Store. So you can also track yours and see if there's any changes in like the BIOS or the titles, etc. Which can obviously help with ASO and then the creator check.

If I was to build another app, unfortunately, it wouldn't be a Chill Guy. I just don't think I have an edge in that. But I would build another Christian app app, but for maybe a different niche just because over time I now have an email list of 1.2 million Christians. And you know, Meta has this beautiful thing called lookalike audiences. Makes it so much easier for me to get now a low cost per install whenever I want to build an app there. And operationally it's just so much easier, just kind of create a new app and just put it into the same funnel that you have and then you can also cross sell within your apps and actually sell ad space to another one of your apps for free.",
