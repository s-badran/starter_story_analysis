I saw there's like a huge market need for people who didn't understand how to get into Bitcoin or Ethereum. They didn't know what Coinbase was. They know how to open up a wallet. So I just saw an opportunity like any other entrepreneur. I had no money, so I borrowed. I got a loan from my father, got the lawyers, got the company ready, all that kind of stuff. And we just started taking in clients. 2017 markets were great, very bullish. Everything went to the moon until 2018 came around and pretty much I lost all my money. I had a lot of money in the crypto markets. Of course the company got rinsed. And then a few months later, I get hit with this email out of nowhere from the cftc. I guess there was like some like, accusations of, like, oh, I took client money or stuff like that. Every time I got an email from these people, it was like, it was devastating. It was devastating to get an email from them, but it was also devastating every day thinking, like, are they going to do something Today, are they going to email me today? Are they going to. Who knows what? Because you're at their full mercy. You're at the full mercy of the government at that point and you got really nothing. We later settled with them after I think like two or three years of dealing with this issue. It was like a $400,000 total settlement. Still paying for it to this day. The whole process cost us $50,000 before we even got to a trial, before anything like that. Because I was broke at the time, I couldn't pay any of it. I had to completely borrow it from my parents. Having to do that was like devastating. You know, as like a child, you want to make your parents proud and you want to make them happy. Everyone was really happy for me when I first started my company and they were very impressed and all that kind of stuff. And then here I am having to beg for their help or else I'm going to get crushed like a bug, like by the government. And it was, it was a horrific situation. But thank God, my parents, I'm blessed to have loving parents and they're always there for me and they always have been there for me. So really appreciate that.",

Is the content I'm reading right now human or is it AI and TikTok? Because I guess spies on the neural nets of your brain or something like that. Just knew I was thinking about this and served me up a video in my timeline. It's like, hey, there's this AI detector called GPT0. They're able to scan with like a 99% accuracy. Is this content AI generated or not? So I started going to work just reverse engineering it, really trying to figure out can I consistently beat this AI detector and keep making it say that this is human generated. After a few days of like trialing it, I cracked it. Like eventually it just. Every single response I was throwing through the AI detector was coming up human. And I was like, okay, we got something here. And so around January is like when I first had the idea for stealth GPT after seeing that TikTok video. And then in February, I bought the domain stealth GPT AI for 75 bucks a year and they make you buy two years minimum. So it's $150 by March.
