So a domain from a different business that I've already owned and that has been indexed with Google already. I created a completely fake demo for this product because the product wasn't there yet and put it on this landing page. I think it's the most low effort way to validate the idea because I wanted to find out if people would actually pay for this. I knew building this AI caller, which was the initial idea, would require a lot of effort. And for me, I just wanted to find out what would business owners pay for this. So would it be worth building?",

There was really nothing else on this page and it ranked on Google with this. So this was version one. I wanted to automate cold calls. So my idea was, okay, let me put cold called automation as the H1 keyword. So I went to Ahrefs, found this keyword, saw it has a search volume but no difficulty. So I put this as the H1 here. This is the main keyword that Google will index. And then I just put some like ChatGPT generated text here to like have some a little bit more text on the page. Here's the demo is like a fake AI caller demo that I generated with 11 labs. So yeah, the call to action is literally just a calendar link of mine. If prospects see the video demo, then they would usually go and book a demo call after that and then I would chat with them about, okay, what do you actually need in your business? So one of the key elements here is getting this landing page indexed immediately. And ideally you have already a domain that is online of a previous startup of yours, your personal page, whatever, a domain that is not brand new. Once a page is created, you go to Google Search console and request the indexing of that page. That way you make sure this page is literally indexed within 24 hours and people can find it on Google.",

And that happened in February 2024. And I was surprised there was even a company with a billion dollar revenue booking a call with me. For me, that was a clear sign. That is insane. Nobody else is doing this. This is an underserved opportunity. We should do this right now. Because if I can rank with a fake landing page for this keyword and this big company books a call with me, I should do this opportunity.",

      "text": "Step one have a job. I think the best pain point to find B2B ideas is not look around on Reddit or something because business owners, frankly they don't really check Reddit. The best way to be in a business is having a job at some point of your life. So having a job I think is actually an absolute advantage compared to indie hackers or builders who never had a job because they don't really know all the processes that happen in a business. Step number two Set up a landing page. Do some basic SEO research. Go to ahrefs or go to any free SEO tool. Search for keywords that buyers would search for. Step 3 Set up a calendar link. They see your face on a call, they know you're a real human, they trust you and then you try to close them on a call and try to swipe their credit card while you're on a sales call. Step four the deposit framework. Don't say please pay for my non existing solution or even make them pay monthly for something that is not there. The better way is deliver as much value as you can and give them a 100% refundable deposit offer. Say for example $500. You take down. It's a one time payment that you take and the buyer gets full access to your product once it launches. You can also put some urgency in there. For example, this secures you a spot in the first launch of the product. Also one big point, go high ticket. If you go this route and do a do a call with the buyer, don't charge him $20 or something, charge them something serious so you know they are in. Nothing validates your idea more than someone swiping their credit card. Step 5 Give it some time to incubate. So if you go to SEO route it's going to take a little bit of time but you will get serious buyers because they search for a solution. So give it a little bit of time to incubate.",

      "text": "I love how Timo shared the exact framework for how to validate before building. Collecting cash before writing code is definitely the way to go, especially if you want to ship a successful app as a solo founder. But when it comes to actually building the app, you might lose all momentum. So many founders waste weeks, if not months on the UI stage, tweaking, spacing and buttons and second guessing every layout at 1am in the morning. And that's where Mobin comes in. And yes, they're today's sponsor, but honestly, they're one of my favorite tools for getting out of the design spiral fast and building something beautiful. Mobin is basically a giant organized vault of real world product designs, actual apps, actual screens, broken down by feature, flow, style, all of it. So instead of guessing on how to design a pricing page or an onboarding flow, you can just see how the best apps in the world do it and build from that 10 times faster. Maubin has personally saved me hours and honestly, it makes designing kind of fun. Again, just click the first link in the description if you want to check out Mobin. Right now they're offering starter story members 20% off their annual pro plan. Huge thank you to Maubin for supporting this video. So let's get back into it. I'm also curious to hear from you guys. You're busy building your business, but I'm sure you're seeing lots of other cool ideas you could be building right now. What are some good ideas that you think are worth starting in 2025?",

That was SEO and content. Once we launched our actual website for Setter AI, within a week we ranked on page one on Google and now ranked number one worldwide for this keyword. The SEO growth came through three main strategies. First, building free tools that people can search up such as Free sales script generator. Second, blog articles that compare to other big tools in the space, for instance something like HubSpot alternatives. The third one, and that's a very underrated one, is definitely YouTube long format. Most of the customers we closed came through watching at least one YouTube video before jumping on a call. YouTube and watching long format content by nature has this high intent from the watcher but then also creates insane trust and into your business already. Also it's the second biggest search engine after Google. Think about that.",
