And once people hear about this year's deal, I'm positive it's going to sell out even faster. So if you don't want to miss out on that, just go to starterstory.com black Friday or hit the first link in the description and we'll notify you as soon as the deal is live. Spots are going to be very limited for this. So what are you waiting for? All right, let's dive into the interview. Okay, so you get this idea up on the App Store, you're ready to go.

And we launched the new version on April 15th, where we were at 1700 dollar MRR and around 15 downloads a day. This is after a few months of no marketing the next month we go all in on marketing again for the NBA playoffs and all of a sudden our conversion rate to paid was over 50%.

When you know how to build and what to change, you can iterate fast and optimize based on what your users actually need. And this is exactly what we teach inside. Starter Story Build. Starter Story Build is our live program where you will learn how to build and launch your project using AI tools in just a few weeks. You'll learn how to think like a developer and how to use AI to build real working products. Just like Eyal and Yali, Our next accelerator is starting soon, so if you're ready to start building, if you're ready to get off the sideline lines, head to the first link in the description to claim your spot. All right, now let's get back to the video. Okay, so you guys realize that, no offense, there's a better way of saying it, but you had a bad product or the product wasn't simple enough. But it took you guys a while to realize this. For anyone that's watching this right now, who's built something or thinking about building something, what would be your advice on how to figure out how to build a great product? What are the actual things you should be doing every day to avoid this mistake, or at least fix it if it happens?",

Using analytics platforms like posthog and simply talking to enough users, you see that there is a pattern of human behavior that doesn't align with how the app is designed. For example, on superwall, we saw that a lot of people were converting to the trial, but then nobody was staying after. Like, what does that really say about your users? What it means is that your users think this is a great idea. They think that this could add a lot of value to their life, but when it actually comes to using the app, it's not the experience they were hoping for. These signals is what a good product manager should do. And it's going to mean that your business model Will work a lot better when you make sure that your product actually best fits your users.",

If you track all of the feature clicks on your app, you can identify your app's most compelling value proposition and then communicate that in your marketing. Any way that you can see what your customers is actually doing is a massive advantage.",

Their followers engage deeply and convert faster when they see someone that they admire using your product. Another great advantage of organic social media marketing is the chance to go viral. So for example, probably our 70th video to ever come out hit 600,000 views and that raised our ARR from around 8k to 38k in about 3 days. And that's really the power of influencer marketing.

Make sure we have the Bandwidth for all the calls that we make. LLM costs cost about $20 a month and the cost is constantly going down. Marketing is about $10,000 a month.
