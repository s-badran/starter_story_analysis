And at that time, Notion released their official Notion API. There was a gap between what users needed and what's available in Notion. So I said, okay, I need to validate if there's going to be a need for that kind of integration to sync Google Sheets with Notion. So what I did, I went to Reddit, I checked the subreddit of Notion and search for keywords like Sheets, Google Sheets, Excel, CSV, all related keywords to what I was trying to build and Validate and I found a lot of people like trying to export the information from notion into sheets to work with the data. I was confident to build an MVP in two weeks. So I just built MVP and started to find users and beta testers to be the shot.",

There's a lot of companies and small businesses using QuickBooks for accounting and they need to move the information to check the invoices, the payment orders and everything and work with that data. And doing that in Zapier is kind of messy. You need to create different subs for updates, for creates, deletes and everything. So if you're able to build that in just one piece of software that does everything, you're going to be solving a huge pain point for customers.",

I did freelance in eight years. It's kind of hard. You have an entrepreneur spirit. You want to make the decisions and sometimes you're not in charge. So yeah, I was kind of tired of that kind of work. I wanted to create my own schedule for the day, just be able to build things, be with a computer and solve problems.

But if I were to look for ideas I could use, I think Upwork could be a great place to find ideas because you can go there and see what people are looking for to build. And maybe if you can translate that into a known solution to offer to other users, I think they'll could be some really good insights in there.",

Is this for for individuals? You can check the existing pricings to see what's the potential for for that idea. That's kind of the first step. Then if I'm going to continue building, I need to know that I'm going to be able to have something that differentiates me from the rest of the products that already exist. If I can't find that angle, I maybe look for something else. Because if you are not able to differentiate yourself, it's going to be hard to enter into the market. And then yeah, try to find your first five users willing to try it out. Right. Use Reddit, use X, use Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups as well. Having those users using the app while you are building it, it's amazing. Like it's really like the insights and all the validation that you get that you're building exactly what they need is super important.",

If you're a solo dev or SaaS builder like Leandro, you know that marketplaces are one of the smartest ways to grow and build a business. You don't need an audience, you don't need to run ads. You just need to build something people already need where they already are. And one marketplace that's flying under the radar right now is Monday.com it's a multi product plat with products for project management, CRM, service management and more. They've got over 245,000 customers across over 200 industries and over 90% of their enterprise customers use apps on the marketplace. That is massive built in demand. And what's great is that the money.com marketplace isn't saturated yet, so this is a good chance to get in early and stand out while the opportunity is wide open. They've made it super dev friendly with robust APIs, MCP support, flexible SDKs, and a team that's actually invested in helping your app succeed. Plus, monetization is native. You set the pricing and they handle the billing and payments. We worked with them to put together this free ebook that breaks down the exact type of users on Monday.com, what they need, and where the biggest opportunities are. Click the first link in the description to grab it, brainstorm your next idea and start building. Thanks to Monday.com for supporting the channel. Now let's get back to Leandro's story. Let's talk about the launch of this. So you built it and then what happened? Did you put it on the marketplace and how many users did you get? Tell me about what the launch process was like, yeah.",

So I searched keywords related to the product and started to have conversations with users, both in the groups and in personal DMs. So that way I got some. Some first users to try the application and the same with the marketplace. Once the application is in the marketplace, if there's someone looking for something Notion related, they're going to find it and they're going to try it. Also, something that really helped was having a chat interface in the landing page at the beginning, because that way you can have real conversations with customers and with users and try to understand what they need.",

I realized I needed to do SEO stuff and so I started to think about what kind of blog post I could write that user confine interesting and related to Notion and Google Sheets. So that's right now one of our main traffic channels. And I also use Red a lot. I have a service called F5bot that is free that lets you track different keywords on Reddit. So I set up some keyword tracking related to CSV sheets in that super edit. And every time I get an email with a notification that a new post or comment was added, I just go there and reply. Of course you need to try to be not spammy and really give value to the users. And if your product can be a solution for their problems, then you recommend your product. You say you are the founder. I also did a launch on Product Hunt a year and a half after launching the product for the first time. So that's also was a really nice source of traffic. Not paying customers, but yes, traffic and visibility. And I remember I also posted on Hacker News. I got to the front page, I was crazy. The spike you get in traffic is amazing, but again the same. It doesn't translate into paying customers. It's just visibility backlinks that improve the rating. But that's it.",

I really love mixed finding because you are able to know exactly what each user is doing with application. I use Padel as my payment processor instead of Stripe because Stripe is not available in Argentina. And I use TDO as a customer support tool to have the chat in the in the landing page.

They didn't need to pay. So I made a decision to remove the free plan. It was risky, there was a lot of people angry, all that. But basically in that moment we went from 5k to 8k in 2 months.

So that's the moment when you realize that there was not enough value for them.
