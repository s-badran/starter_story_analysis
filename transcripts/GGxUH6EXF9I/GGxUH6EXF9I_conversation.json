And so my goal was to replace a $2,000 a month income at the restaurant. We didn't call it finding products market fit. We didn't call it bootstrapping. In our minds, it was a couple of broke dudes trying to figure out ways to get people to wear and buy our product. And I think there's something really interesting where when you are starting anything, you have an idea for a business. You don't really know what you don't know. You know, you don't know things, but you actually don't know what it is. And the best way to learn what you don't know is to talk to people that know what you don't. And so when I think about Starter Story and why I fell in love with it, it is a library of inspiration, practical advice, stories that you can learn from and apply to your own situation. So whether you're looking for a product that you want to be inspired to try and launch yourself, or you just want to find about rad entrepreneurs that started where you are so you can see yourselves in them. I think Starter Story solves all of those problems.",

Who are people of influence that I could send my product to that would maybe supercharge our growth or get more exposure for us. And one of them was Andy Dalton. And Andy Dalton was the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals at the time. And I'd gone to tcu, and I was good buddies with his wife there. I thought, well, I'm going to send Jordan, his wife, a Facebook message. Hey, congratulations on getting married. We just started this company. I thought Andy might like one. Would he be interesting? Could I send it to you as a wedding gift? Sure enough, a couple months later, she responded, said, hey, Andy would love to give one a shot. And I remember, like, dancing in my living room, right? Like, this is it. This is a moment. So I sent it to him and I got a thanks. And that was about it. Nothing else really happened. Fast forward to a couple months from then. There's a show called hard Knocks on HBO. The first episode aired 10 minutes of the episode was about Andy wearing a rubber wedding ring. And they interviewed him. In the interview, he was like, oh, I just think it's really cool. I can wear it no matter what it is that I'm doing. I can wear it out on the field. And it represents the commitment that I've made to my wife, which is super important to me, but also represents what I do for a living, which is we could not have sent him a script that was a better way of articulating exactly what our positioning was as a company. The next day, I think we did 3 or 4x sales. We would line up the envelopes and put the labels on of the customers. And this was the first time that it went all the way to the end of the house. And we had more orders. This was this moment for us of this is real and watching orders laid out all over my mom's house with trash bags of rings that we were yet to cut with eyebrow scissors littered everywhere. So it was very much this moment in time where there was validation, there was an uptick in sales, there was engagement, and people were talking. But two days later, everybody goes back to living their lives. And it's what you do with that attention in between your next venture to try and get more attention or have another moment that ultimately matters the most. So this moment with Andy Felt like affirmation, which was really cool. But it also was terrifying because you realize, oh, this thing could become something. And now I actually have to build it.

When you grow a company that size and you grow that fast, you realize how big the stakes are pretty quickly. You begin to learn that mistakes are costlier. At that stage. But the success of it I'm incredibly grateful for. And it was unexpected. It was never in our heads. We're going to be this big company. It was always focus on being better as a company, not bigger. And then it was, who are our customers and how do we know them better than anyone in business Building, you can't build it without incredible people. And looking back on Kayla, that's what I appreciate the most were the people that I did it with. And even though we didn't do everything perfectly, we had a lot of success as a result of the team that we built in growing it. You should be able to communicate to anyone as an entrepreneur, this is the problem that I'm solving. Start there, then determine what the product is to solve that problem. And just like the rings, even if they're terrible, focus instead of making it perfect on getting it to customers and then talking to as many of those customers as you possibly can about how to make it better. We are so concerned with other people's perception of us and our product and what we're doing that it paralyzes us. And so if you have this idea for a business and you want to start it and you're so concerned with, is it going to be successful? What are people going to think of me? Is it going to be dumb? It's really freeing to realize that people actually aren't thinking about you at all.
