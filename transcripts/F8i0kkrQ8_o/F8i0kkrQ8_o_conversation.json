Within a couple of hours it got like 40,000 views. Lots of people mentioned that they would love to see this as an open source project. So over the weekend I actually built it at least the first mvp, the first version that was usable and pushed out on Monday, the launch tweet and it got like 100k views. And then soon after their first customers came and were asking like, can we give you money to buy the service? And that's kind of how it kicked it off.",

So you know exactly what happened. And the papermark is essentially alternative to the Docsend and other data room providers which exist already for 10 years or more. But they like don't innovate anymore, they don't produce anything new, they mostly focus on the enterprise customers. That's why the open source kind of new solution was needed in this market.",

And the cool thing is that the entire history of the project is also publicly available. It also opens up the project globally to any developer in the open source ecosystem that likes to contribute or that it's interested in the project and wants to contribute to it. There are of course, licenses that have some protective mechanism and in the end you have these communities that form around each project and they can be larger or smaller depending on the popularity of the project or the maintainer as well. A lot of developers these days, they want to show off their work, maybe they can't find a job, but they can do open source projects. They can contribute to open source in order to advance their own career. So attracting early users, open source is great because you can just ultimately ship in public.",

We have a hosted version that we charge for for the OpenCore model. Our core software of Papermark is open source and self hostable. And then if you need advanced features, you can acquire a license and still run it on your infrastructure as a self hosted version, but just with our enterprise license attached it so that you can enjoy the full suite just as it is on papermark.com Looking back, what.",

There's no need for anyone else to kind of build the same project and charge anything for it because it's essentially already as low as it can get. Number two, it's very scalable because there's essentially zero barrier to entry. We have people coming to our project every day, day looking at it, either contributing to it, running it for their small teams, or then seeing the open source project and converting actually to papermark.com because they don't want to deal with the self hosting of it. They just come to us because we do the best service in hosting the solution. Number three, we have that community driven R and D velocity. Incumbents only have like their employees that basically maintain the software. We have the community that basically looking through the projects, monitoring it, seeing where they can contribute new features. If they find like issues, they can immediately swoop in and like provide a solution for it. The velocity with the community is just like immense. And number four, it's very secure and has high trust. The code can be audited by any third party. You're not hiding behind proprietary software that we need to grant access to someone at a bank that is trying to evaluate whether it would be a great fit for the infrastructure. They have to run through so many checks and they can do that very easily just by auditing our open source code and seeing that nothing nefarious is going on and everything is extremely secure.",

As a founder, you're likely moving fast towards product market, fit your next funding round or your next big enterprise deal. But with AI accelerating how quickly startups are building and shipping, security expectations are higher earlier than ever. Getting security and compliance for your business right can unlock growth, but it can also stall it if you wait too long.

I'll put a link in the top of the description for you to check it out. Thank you Vanta, for sponsoring the channel. I love the platform that you're building.

It just makes it so easy to create like a very small differentiated business off of an existing incumbent. The kind of like key markets that I see today that are being rebuilt is anything that has to do with like a CRM. They have become so large that the software itself is very complex and they try to do this like one size fits all, where of course once you're in at like the highest tier, you can then customize it to your own use case. But why not build a very targeted CRM for veterinarians or like office building managers that have like a very specific use case to use the CRM but and don't need like the entire complexity. Think about reducing complexity in what existing businesses are there and just like build it very simple. Think to yourself like, is there an open source alternative? Does it make sense to build an open source alternative? Is the market massive? Is there enough room for other players in the market? Because oftentimes you will find that software is not really the differentiator. So being open and open source is no detriment to you or your business.",

There's no downside to sharing the small progress even that you're making, even if the features are not 100% complete. Share that on Twitter, on LinkedIn, just with anyone and you'll slowly gather community around that. Then lastly, in terms of growth, we also participated in this month long Open source hackathon called Hacktoberfest. There is like a cycle where we build faster more customer notice that we're building and shipping features whereas the incumbents are slow and like sleeping.

You want to become the clear successor to the incumbents, not just be an alternative. That's also there. And you need to turn that excitement around open source and into product momentum.

I would definitely, if you want to try open source and see really what it is, you need to kind of jump into it. You will not get the whole idea.
