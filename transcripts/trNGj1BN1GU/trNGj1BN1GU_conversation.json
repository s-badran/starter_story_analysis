We'll go and repurpose viral clips and viral videos, or even full videos and full podcasts. We have long form posts, which is a new thing. We have articles, replies, you can do spaces, you can help set up spaces. There's really so much that goes into it now, and certain niches have different formats of content that are going to perform the best.

Drop shipping, affiliate marketing, crypto, day trading, blogging. You name it, I've done it. And then from there, I quickly realized that I'm a little introvert. I played video games, I've had a blog, I did marketing in college, and I've done a little bit of writing. I've actually been on Twitter since 2011. So when I chose copywriting, I probably had like 2,000 bucks to my name. It was. It was pretty. It was a challenging time. But I'm the kind of person that kind of. I always knew that I would make more money. Like, I always had that mindset. I bought a course back then, it was like 50 bucks a month. And it kind of taught me the ins and outs of the ghostwriting thing. It gave me an offer, and after I signed my first client for 1000 bucks and I found a second one for a thousand bucks, I reinvested all 2,000 into a bigger course that cost me 2,000 bucks per month.

And that took about a few weeks before I kind of really landed some interest and I was able to sign my first 1k a month client. I didn't get the best results at the time, but what I did get was he spent sent me a message and it said like, I got seven free trial subscribers. And I was like, got testimonial?",

And that was a coach and we crushed it for him. This was the first time I really crushed it for someone viral every week. And not only that, what I realized is it drove sales. And I was like, okay, he's paying me 3k a month and this thread probably made him like 20, 30k. So it's like, okay, well he just made enough money to pay me for 10 months. So from there it was like referrals. And inbound is. I just focused on getting my clients good results so the referrals would come in. My audience was building at the time. I think at the time I was going 3k 5k followers. I think I had 10k followers after like 8 months in business. And then from there it's just been compounding ever since.",

What it allowed me to do is have a framework to follow. Hey, why are you on this call? And kind of take them through a little bit of a journey on the call. But ultimately what I've really come down to is if you can just get on a call, tell someone how you actually are going to help them and be honest and be a human, most of the people actually vibe with that and if they don't vibe with that, you probably don't want to work with them anyway. Sales is really just about conviction. So if you actually believe in what you're doing can actually help someone make more money. It's pretty easy to sell.",

So that's number one. And that's really just saying, hey, giving them a compliment based on checking out their profile, giving them your offer, and then saying, hey, if you're interested, let me know. If not, you're good. Don't even answer. You don't want to be kind of too pushy. And then what's called warm DMs, it's just essentially DMing people who are following you, engaging with your content, et cetera. It all starts with kind of creating content on your Twitter. You always want to practice what you preach. And then what's called hot DMs, which is the people who are already interested, they're DMing you. First, they're saying, hey, I'm interested. Right. So using those three and having a happy balance, that's how you can really accelerate the clients that you land. So it all starts with making content, sending cold and warm dms and getting the inbound leads, and it compounds very fast. Like a hundred DMS, 200 DMs a day, two to three tweets a day, including like a thread, and you're golden from there.",

So tactic hunting especially what we just talked about would be you're trying to plan out, what am I going to write, how am I going to send DMs, what's going to be my script? The implementing is actually going out and doing it and doing it not just once, not just for a week, but for six months, 12 months straight, and doing it every single day. That's the implementing piece that really helps it compound because in the back end, you're actually delivering your servicing, like I said, getting referrals and getting Leads inbound, but then also doing the outbound. And when you combine those, you kind of create a flywheel. And then, honestly, after 10, 20k a month, I'd say every business has kind of a different point where you have to ask yourself, do I want to be a solopreneur or do I want to be an entrepreneur? And that's when I decided to start hiring team members and building a real business under a real business name. Now we're doing about 70k a month, and our margins are about 60%. We have two senior writers, one junior writer. I have an ops manager who was my real employee number one. She was my assistant, now my ops manager. And then I have a sales representative as well.

We use Hemingway is a really great app that'll actually help you with your writing. It'll show you which level, grade you're writing at and help you dumb it down and make it simpler. We use a tool called Hype Fury to go and schedule all the tweets, and we can schedule them there for clients, and you can actually have client account access without actually being in the client's account. And then we also use Notion, which is where we have kind of our company dashboard, CRMs, client hubs, everything like that. So I'd say those are really the main tools.",

The I have no money way is actually go on Twitter and be a user, start to follow people that are going viral and follow people that are actually writing great content, study what they're doing, do it for yourself, use yourself as the case study, and then use that to do the DMs. The paid way would be to buy a course. And I always say this. When you buy a course, just copy exactly what they tell you. The most important thing is to do it yourself and actually build yourself a bit of a personal brand. Because what I quickly found out is if I was reaching out to somebody with more followers than me, they'd be like, well, I have more followers than you. Why would I hire you?

And then Tuesdays, I like to have just like a blank calendar. And those are usually the days where I'm gonna sit down and edit some client content because I'm still acting as chief editor. Or I'll go out and maybe source some new clients, or I'll talk to the team or work on the business. Wednesday again, it's usually a call day slash content day. And now as I'M stepping out more. As a CEO, I try to spend a lot more time thinking, I try to go on walks, stuff like that. But yeah, again, I say a majority of my time is either in or on the business. And I don't really do a ton else. I know we live in Miami, but I don't really go out. I don't really party or anything like that.

But what I ultimately learned was once you can finally shut that out and stick to one thing and actually fail through it and keep going, find your itty bitty bits of success and again, continue to shut out the noise. Because again, even at 2k a month, 3k a month, 5k a month, 10k a month, you're still seeing all that stuff. It's not like it just goes away.
