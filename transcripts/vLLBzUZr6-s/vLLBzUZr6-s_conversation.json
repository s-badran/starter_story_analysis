All of their apps are kind of technical and a bit complex for regular users. And the other type of apps was VC backed or like huge corporations. The user experience was great, but the problem about them was that they actually move pretty slow. If there's a feature lacking, it would take probably months or maybe even a year to launch something new. So that's how I kind of knew that there is an opportunity for me to be in that ecosystem and to try to beat all of those solid developers. I wasn't sure that I will be able to compete with bigger companies backed by VCs and so on. But like a year or two years after doing Shopify apps, I realized that it's possible to compete with them as well.",

Since day one, I was always thinking, how can I 10x my earnings? And I quickly, I realized that if I want to earn more, I have to work like for myself. I have to start freelancing. So that's what I did in 2016 or 2015, I guess. Three to four years later, while I was still freelancing, I was building products on the side. I had a client, a startup who needed a landing page. So what I was doing, I was just browsing the Internet and looking for it in inspiration. And that's how I stumbled upon Shopify Partners page. Bookmarked it and later on when I looked into it, I saw a section which said that top 25% Shopify app developers are making almost 300k a year. And in my eyes it was like, oh my God, it's huge. Because what I was making with my freelance work was much less having all of the experience in Shopify. I knew how those apps were and that's how I realized that I have to build something myself in the ecosystem.",

I have to build it in like couple of months, no more than that. The second criteria was pretty broad market. I wanted to build something that could be useful for any Shopify store because it would be a lot easier to market it and I could use all of my clients that use Shopify and so on. The third criteria was I needed low competition. So that's my main, my main setup, how, how I differentiate good ideas versus bad ideas.",

I posted various Facebook posts in those groups and one of the posts where I had a screenshot of my not published app. It was just a design and it kind of blew up. There was more than 100 likes and a lot of comments asking, you know, where can I download this app? Because they thought that it's already live. So that was my first validation that this product is needed. And yeah, it could be successful. If you can build a landing page or something to try get, get the emails of your customers, that's great. If you can even charge for it, maybe make a pre order or something that's, that's even better because you already know that people will pay money for it.",

      "text": "All right, I got to stop you real quick and zoom out. Erica built an insane business. 4 million a year on top of the Shopify app store without spending any money on ads. And that's maybe the secret. Building on top of a marketplace, you don't need a big audience, you don't need to spend money on ads, and there's a built in customer base just waiting for you to solve their problem. The only problem with that is that Shopify's developer ecosystem is, I'll admit, pretty mature. In other words, that means there's a good amount of competition on the platform. So that begs the question, what's the next Shopify? What's the under the radar marketplace where I think developers should be building right now? Well, one place I think is interesting is the Monday.com marketplace. We partner with them on this video because they're putting real energy behind expanding the marketplace, investing in the platform, supporting developers, and actively looking for more builders to help meet their growing customer demand. Now is the time to get in early and make your mark while it's still easier to stand out. They've got over 245,000 customers across over 200 industries and 90% of their enterprise customers use Monday.com apps. Enterprise, that's the big bucks. What's also cool is they have good APIs, clean docs, solid SDKs, and a team dedicated to helping you grow and make money. If this tickles your fancy. Well, with Monday.com we put together this free download, breaking down a bunch of stats about the opportunity here, who their users are and what kind of problems they really need solved. And here's a pro tip. Take some of that info and plug it into your favorite LLM and I bet it will give you some really cool ideas for what to build. If you want to download, just click the first link in the description, fill out the quick form, and sign up for your developer account. It's all 100% free to get started. I'm stoked that we got to partner with Monday.com in this video because air cost is an example of what happens when you build on a marketplace. All right, let's get back to the interview. You're a designer, not a developer. How do you go about actually building these products? What's your process to go from zero to one with a new idea?",

      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Yeah, so when I'm. When I'm designing things, the first thing I look into is competitors. If there's already competitors in space, that's a good thing because you can dig into deeper and see how they do, like see their user experience. Just go through it and I'm taking notes what I really like about it and what I dislike about it. And after that, I have a clear image of how my app could look like so that I could fairly say that it's objectively better than my competitors. And to make my chance for success higher, I have to find a co founder. I think finding a co founder is pretty much similar to doing sales because you have to sell someone an idea that you can make a successful business and you just need their help. That's what I was trying to do. You know, I went into a local developer group in Facebook. I made a huge post and I mentioned that, you know, first of all, I have Shopify experience. Second, I'm a great designer with years of experience, so I can provide a great user experience which will increase our chance for success. Third, I have all of those clients already using Shopify, which we can sell our Shopify app to. And with all of those things, you know, I think I'm increasing my chance for finding a right fit. And that's basically how I found my co founder.",

So yeah, I just went to all of the communities, I just went to all of my clients, all of My friends that are using Shopify and ask them to install our app and try it for themselves. I made the app free, and this way you can get more installs and of course more installs then convert to more reviews. And of course it drives more revenue then and it helps, you know, to improve your product further because you get all of this feedback.",

So every month we're sending a monthly email in which we show how much revenue this app brought to you. And in that email we also ask for review. I think around 95% of our reviews for our apps come from customer support. Our customer support is top notch. All of our customer support agents are really technical, so they can dig into your code and fix things. And yeah, we provide 24. 7 customer support right now.",

Vote for gathering feature suggestions so every user can go to that board and suggest a feature or just upvote for other features that they think that we need to implement. Another tool that we're using is linear so we use it internally for our task management. Last but not least, we use Mental. You have everything Shopify related there. You can set up affiliate partnerships, you can see all of the metrics, all of the funnels, customer management and so on. Since day one our profitability was around 90%.
