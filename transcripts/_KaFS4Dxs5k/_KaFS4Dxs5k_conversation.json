So majority of them were using it because they wanted a conversational form. And when I talked to them and found that they were using it as an alternative to Typeform, I found that Typhoon recently raised their pricing. So then I found there was like a gap in the market. But pricing is something that I found. Like this can't be the only reason. So I then searched Twitter, Reddit, Typeform's own forum and all I found there are like some other features as well as users want and Typhoon is not providing. So then I sold that chatbot builder bot Flow and started working on new phones.",

Step one, you look for a popular tool and search social platforms like Twitter and Reddit with keywords like X alternative, where X is basically the product with lots of users. So for in my case it was Typeform. Then step two, find the pain points or gaps which they are not solving. It is fine if the pain point is pricing, but only if pricing is too high. Then step three, reach out to those users with your solution with just a basic landing page explaining your solution. So messaging is the key here. And bonus point, step four, have a tool to simply easily migrate your competitor's user to your platform with a one click. In viewform, we have a landing page where you can paste your Typeform URL and it will generate a new form within a few seconds. So people can see like, okay, this is what we are getting a new form.",

This is my personal pain point I have faced because we are a small startup and Canny has recently trying to go up market. So I searched for a lot of canny alternatives in the market, but none as simple as canny. Apart from that, there is a one gap that I found recently. This is an app where you can build your forest, the digital forest, by doing some habits. And why you should build an alternative right now is if you search with the latest reviews there, most of them are one star. I think these are the things that you should do. But you will find that there are people who say that okay, Facebook is crap, I don't want to go there. But definitely don't build things like a social media and marketplace or something that is something that as an indie hacker you should always stay on.",

No, seriously, what project have you been thinking about for a long time? Maybe It's a micro SaaS like the one we're talking about today. Or maybe it's just a simple tool that will help you be more productive. Whatever it is, AI has made it possible possible to build anything. But let's be honest, it's still really hard to figure out where to start. I get DMS every single day from people asking me how to build, what to build and what tools to actually use. So I decided to create something that makes it easier for you to build with AI. It's called Starter Story Build and it's our program where in just a few days you'll go from a simple idea to a production ready app. You'll get guidance from our resident experts and you'll get the roadmap for how to build with AI forever. Honestly, I wish this existed when I was just starting out. So if you're curious, check out the link in the description to learn more about Starter Story Build. All right, let's get back to the episode. I'd love to learn a little bit more about you form and just walk me a little bit through kind of how you built it. Just give me a high level overview of like what you did until you got the first paying customer and so on.",

So we initially didn't do anything which might be like a fancy landing page or a logo or anything like that. The first version of viewform had just you can collect some data using like fields like name, email, star rating and all. And apart from that you can just download your data as a CSV. There was no Integrations with Google Sheet, API etc, nothing was available there. So this was an MBB that I think I built in two weeks. And the landing page was a basic landing page that time which just had a start using you form which used to take you to the UFORM builder and later on like my wife created the current PA when we got like I guess 200 plus users.",

We are actually basically in a freemium model, I guess 90% plus of features are free. So our conversion rate is around somewhere around 1.5 to less than 2% traffic per month. We get around 35,000 visitors per month, unique visitors. And apart from that, a good stat right now is we have recently crossed 4 million form submissions.",

So I wanted to keep the stack which I am comfortable with. And it is hosted on aws. Amazon aws. We use cloudflare for security and storage. Apart from that stripe for payments. We use OpenAI a lot for fraud detection because our freemium model lots of bad users come in who tries to game the system. Then we use Slite for help docs. They are great apart from then Gmail for bugs based simple analytics for web analytics, Canny for feedback management and mailgun for email. Email then in total I think our last month expense was around less than $1,200.",

There are a lot of low hanging fruit out there that exist like this where you can go find a big company, figure out what users like and dislike and then build that micro version of it. It's not necessarily easy, but the strategy is pretty simple and I think it's very doable. And with tools like Lovable and Cursor you can spin up these projects and get started and have a real working prototype in just a few hours. And that's exactly why we built and launched Starter Story Build. In a few days you'll learn how to build stuff with AI and who knows, in a few months you might have your own $10,000 per month micro SaaS. If you're interested in Starter Story Build, head to the first link in the description to learn more. Thank you again for watching. I'll see you in the next one Pen.",
