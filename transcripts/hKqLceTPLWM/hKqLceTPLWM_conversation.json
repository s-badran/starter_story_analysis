Well, what I'm going to share with you today is the difference between apps that make millions and apps that die with zero downloads. Don't believe me? Well, here's proof. Meet Stephen, a founder who took his mobile app from zero to $40,000 mrr and then sold it for a life changing amount. Stephen's not a famous influencer. He's an actual founder in the arena who discovered a playbook that changed his life forever. You might remember him from his last Starter Story video. Well, that video got a million view and I asked him if he wanted to come back on the channel. I said, dude, why don't you come on again but this time share the full story. Not the surface level stuff, but the actual spreadsheets, the exact viral videos and everything that took you from zero to exit. He said yes. And that's what you're about to see right now. His 10 minute viral validation method, exactly how to go from 0 to 50 million views for free from your apartment. And his simple Strategy to turn $1 into $2 and scale using paid ads. Want to end up on page 500 of the app Store? Well, get out your pen and paper and enjoy the Million Dollar App Playbook by Starter Story. Welcome back to the channel, Stephen. If you can remind the viewers of what you built and what we're going to be talking about today.",

And if your product is not marketable, you could have the best product in the world. But if no one knows about it, you're never going to make any money, it's never going to be a successful business. Marketing should always come first to do that. First we do market research. We understand what's going viral in our niche, what content is working in our niche, and that we can also use that to validate the product in general. Once we have the product validated and we start building it, then we can go into the market research and start to identify what type of content formats we want to recreate. This is exactly what I did for Puff Count. This is the entire reason that I was successful with Puff Count. It's is because I did market research in the quit vaping niche on TikTok and I simply took inspiration from those videos. I posted them organically and then scaled the winners with paid ads. So we have market research post volume, organically scale the winners with paid ads. That is the three step framework in a nutshell. Cool.",

Let's click into one here and let's see if we can find some similarities between this content and some of the content that I created here. In this video, they're dropping their vapes in a glass of water. And if we go to the puff count profile, you can see that we were doing that. That was one of our bread and butter. 33,000 views. It's me dunking a vape into a glass of water. This is not my original idea. I was not the first person on TikTok to put a vape and a glass of water. But I did the market research. I understood that that content was resonating and with my ideal target audience. And I use that concept and created my own videos and then my next part of the process. It's very high tech here.

Now we know that this video in reality was an ad because she is pitching this audiobook by Alan Carr. She said, right? So we know that she was promoting this book in her video and she crushed it. The call to action at the end of the video really quickly, really subtly makes it feel super organic, doesn't feel salesy at all, and those are the best ads. So again, you know, we could sit here for hours and we could analyze these videos and this is what you should do. Before I posted a single video on the Puff Count TikTok, I scrolled for seven days straight. I saved all the videos to the market. Research just like this.

By following this organic growth framework, I grew the Puff count account to 120,000 followers, over 50 million views, and hundreds of thousands of app store installs, all for $0. So when you're creating this content, there is a framework to follow and that framework is hook, problem, solution, or call to action. Obviously, the hook is the most important part. You need to capture that attention in the first three seconds. And I can show an example. One of my most viral videos, this one got 5 million views. I'm shaking this glass bowl of empty vapes. There are so many different elements of this hook and we did this intentionally. Number one, there's a sound hook. We're shaking the glass with vapes in it. There's some crazy sounds going on and then boom, we hop right into the the concept of the video and then you want to present the problem or the storyline clearly. So what are we doing in this video? We're paying people to ditch their vapes. Why? Because vapes are unhealthy. And then of course, at the end of the video, we're going to have a quick two second call to action. The two second call to action. Simply showing the product in your video works so well because if people miss that, they have to rewatch your video again and it creates an engagement loop. People on TikTok do not want to be watching ads. They want to be entertained, they want to be educated, they want to be informed. Your entire app is going to be a funnel, right? And at the very top of the funnel, we have your TikTok video or your TikTok views. You don't need to explain every part in your funnel for your video to be effective. All you have to do is take the person from your TikTok video to the App store. That's exactly what all these videos do, right? There's no, there's no explanation of the product, there's no explaining the features. So if you can do that with your content and present a sly, organic feeling call to action, you will crush.",

All right, let's get back to Stephen. All right, well, the next question that I have for you is, you know, once you start posting stuff, creating stuff, which is a big learning curve for a lot of people, especially putting themselves out on short form video for the first time, what's the posting strategy of this?

What do you recommend is what time to post, how much to to post, and when to know when to stop the posting strategy.",

      "text": "This is where I see a lot of people fail, right? Because in the beginning it's going to be slow. In the beginning, it's going to be hard to get that first viral pop. But the most important thing is staying consistent. Whether you're posting, whether you're getting creators to post, you need to stay consistent with it, right? Don't worry about the time that you post the content, all the small little details of the content. Do not be a perfectionist. Your goal here is volume. Your goal here is knowing generally what direction your content should be going. You're just looking for that first viral video. The way to get there is by posting volume. Volume negates luck, right? So you need to be posting as much as possible. And when you get a video that pops off, recreate that concept. If you look at the most viral people on TikTok, let's forget about businesses for a second. Let's think about just creators, influencers. The most viral people on TikTok, on YouTube, they do the same style of video over and over and over again. There's a reason they do that. And we could take a page out of their playbook and we could do the same thing for our app. The most important part is to stay consistent. Post every single day, post based on your market. Research, it'll give you a much better chance of going viral. And then once you do find a video that pops off for you, continue to recreate that video will become easier and easier for you. An important thing too is once you get that first viral video, the floor of the amount of views that you get will increase over time because the platforms trust you more and there's more engagement to your video. So they will be shown more. All it takes is that first viral video to get you out of that 200 view jail. And also, if you're posting on one platform, why not post on all of them? Download the videos, post them on TikTok, post them on Instagram Reels, post them on YouTube shorts, post them on Twitter. Twitter is so slept on. Do not sleep on Twitter as a distribution. As you start to create more and more content, you're going to understand some formats don't drive high intent installs. They don't drive any conversions for you. There's one example that comes to mind. Yeah, so this video here got 11.6 million views, close to a million likes, and it drove me close to no installs, number one, because I didn't have a call to action. But number two, you know, I'm not really talking about any pain points here. There's not a lot going on. It was kind of a bad video in terms of conversion. It was great for the account and great for driving views and followers and shares and engagement and stuff like that. But this didn't really drive installs for me and I think it's important to keep track of that. And you can see here, you know, there's two videos. These were my two highest converting videos in terms of installs and sales on Puff Count. So I pinned those to the top of my profile and you'll see these are very different styles of video. Again, these follow our proven framework of hook storyline solution. I pinned these videos on my profile because they drove the highest amount of conversions. Your profile itself will become its own funnel. So everyone who visits my profile now is going to watch these two pinned videos for sure, because they're the first videos that show up. And I chose to pin these videos because they were the highest converting videos. And what I've come to find is the highest converting videos for me personally were public interviews, simple product demos like this video. There's trend hijacking as well. And you can also have the problem solution narratives like this video here.",

      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "Pat, I'm so glad you asked. So we finished phase two. We have this library of organic content, and now we want to scale. There's a couple different ways to scale you yourself. You can go beast mode, you could post a thousand videos a day, but that's not very likely. You can hire and outsource creators, which is easier said than done. I think everybody's going through a super distortive process to hire creators right now. You have to email a thousand of them. Only one gets back to you and they give you some outrageous price. But that is exactly why I built my next product, which is posted on posted. What we did was we made it connecting with creators as easy as possible. So this is the best way to work with creators. We have this feature called Deals. For example, you create a project brief, you explain what your product is. You have some rules for the content you want. You could choose where you want the creators to be from, and then you have your inspiration content right here. Going back to our market research, this is where we give the creators our market research. We tell the creators what videos are going viral in our niche, what's working in our niche, and then creators will actually submit videos, videos to your deal for free. So, for example, this creator submitted this video to my deal, and I can watch it for free. And this is what the creator wants to be paid. I can approve this piece of content, or I can reject this piece of content and I can ask for another price or whatever it is. But you can see all these creators made videos for my product for free. And there's all different types of bids, right? This one wants $40, this wants $50. This one wants 100. So you can scroll through these. Approve or deny. You only pay for the ones that you love. And then when you do choose one and you do pay for one, you own the video itself and you own the the ad code so that you can scale it further on paid ads. For example, this creator right Here, who has 552,000 followers, she made a post for us for 110 bucks. It got 30,000 views. This creator here, with 2.7 million followers, 110 bucks a video. Or this creator right here, who only had 768 followers, but made an amazing piece of content for us that got 53,000 views. And again, you know, we own these videos for life. Copy the ad code and scale further on paid ads using Meta or TikTok ads. The first thing that we need to do is start giving data into these paid ad platforms because TikTok and Facebook or any paid ad platform doesn't have enough data on your app yet. So you will need an mmp, a mobile measurement partner to send these events into the paid ad platforms. Adjust is a great one. Apps Flyer is a great one. But we need to feed the paid ad platforms with enough data, right? So your first campaign cannot be a purchase campaign. You can't optimize for those users just quite yet because TikTok and Facebook don't really know who those users are yet. CAC is your customer acquisition cost. So with all of our content and all of our paid ads, our customer acquisition cost on puff count was anywhere around 20 to $24. And our lifetime value was anywhere from 55 to upwards of $70 per conversion. So that was profitable math for us. We knew that if we put $1 into paid ads it would get $2, sometimes even more out on the other end. So here you'll see our paid as dashboard. We spent a total of $82,000 on our paid ads before exiting the business. This is how we scaled from 3K to $44,000 in monthly recurring revenue. And you can see here, look at the cost per click. $0.03 $0.18 $0.21 $0.15 $0.35 $0.09. We got these results almost like day one of running ads because we had this library of proven content. We knew exactly what videos we were going to upload to the paid ads dashboard because we had validated it all organically so we were spending smarter. And this is our four step scaling process in order to optimize your paid ads. Everything is a funnel. Just like our TikTok videos. TikTok profile itself is a funnel. So our paid ads. If you think of everything as a funnel, it becomes so much easier because you don't have to go straight from a view to a sale. That's so hard to do, right? Think of it in a step by step process. Everything is a funnel. So at the top of the funnel we have our views and then obviously we have our clicks. So our views on our paid ads and then people who have clicked our paid ad and then people who have installed our app from our paid ad and then people who have purchased from our paid ad and your views are going to be top of funnel and the sales are going to be at the absolute bottom of the funnel. And inherently there's going to be less people who purchase your product compared to the amount of people that view your products. So when you're starting on paid ads, it's very important that you fill up each step of the funnel first before you start to optimize for the bottom. So first we're going to optimize for views, and then we're going to optimize for clicks on those ads, and then we're going to optimize for installs and then trials and then subscriptions. These are all different events that you can optimize for in your paid ads. Depending on which event you target and optimize for, the cost and the return on that spend will change a ton. So you fill the ad platforms with enough data so that eventually you can start to target your trials and subscriptions. And as far as the platform strategy goes, with paid ads, it really depends, and it's different for every app, right? From my experience with puff count, TikTok was much cheaper traffic, but the quality of the traffic was a little bit lower. Whereas on Meta, the traffic was more expensive, but the quality was a bit higher. Facebook and TikTok are really the only two places that you should start running paid ads. Ultimately, you can test both, depending on your budget. I think it's important to lock down one paid ad platform at first because again, you need to fill these ad platforms with as much data as possible for them to be the most effective. So if you're splitting your budget everywhere and you're spending $5 here and $10 there, it's not really going to work for you. I would try to focus on one platform in the beginning until you lock it down, you nail it down, you scale your budget, and then you can shift to another paid ad platform. For me personally, we scaled most of our spend on TikTok ads, and that was because all of our content that we used on our paid ads was made for TikTok. I was in my apartment making TikToks all day. So naturally, where our content performed the best when we scaled on paid. And a lot of people are scared of paid ads and they don't want to do it. But Facebook and TikTok are some of the most profitable companies in the world for a reason. It's because paid ads work, work. It's because companies are using this. It'll make it so much easier for you to scale. I'm a solopreneur. I'm bootstrapping these products. I don't want to waste my money on paid ads. And you don't have to. You just need to identify what content goes viral organically and then you can spend confidently on paid ads and feel way more confident that you're going to get return on your ad spend. And paid ads are so great because you can optimize for certain events in your videos. And this is really where your content creation skills and validating the content organically comes into play. Because for our specific paid ad strategy, we were optimizing for the people who are most likely to purchase. So we're tracking all These events on TikTok ads on Facebook ads and we are telling Facebook and TikTok go find us more people who are most likely to purchase our product. With the killer organic content library that we had telling Facebook and TikTok to optimize for certain events inside our app. Those are the two things we needed to crush with paid ads. We were profitable almost instantly while running paid ads and we were able to scale very quickly because we had done all the work upfront. And not only that, you can have a call to action in your videos. My view to install rate skyrocketed, obviously running paid ads because TikTok will give you a call to action on the video if you're running paid ads in an organic piece of content. If you're not running paid ads, you have to rely on someone going to the app store searching in your product. That's a lot more effort. Although you're spending for this reach, the reach is much more effective on paid ads. The campaign structure on your paid ads is very, very important. Again, we want to upload our best performing organic videos and then we simply let the platforms optimize again. When you're starting, you want to optimize for the top of funnel and as you get more data and more spend into these ad platforms, you can start to optimize for the bottom of the funnel. It's very important to track everything and use analytics tools like SuperWall or like Revenue Cat. You can effectively track your cost per install, your trial conversion rate, your subscription rate, your retention rate, and most importantly, your lifetime value. The lifetime value of every customer that comes into your app. Because that is your North Star metric, that is your golden metric because TikTok will tell you how much it costs to acquire those customers. But you need to understand what their lifetime value is. You want to increase the lifetime value of your customers so you can spend more to acquire those customers. And if you can get to a 3 to 1 CAC to LTV ratio. Congratulations. You built a money printing machine. So that's it in a nutshell. That is our three step process that helped us scale puffcount to $44,000 in monthly recurring revenue before exiting the business to a larger mobile app studio in Europe. That's it. You start with market research. You give yourself the best chance to go viral. You start posting consistently, hire creators and start to validate content organically. And then you take your best performers and put them on paid ads so that you can scale well.",
