And so it invokes some sort of reaction, which is the key to going viral is, you know, something, what they call emotional arousal, making the viewer feel something. And it doesn't matter what you're making them feel, it just, you need to make them feel like a super intense emotion.

Then we sent it over to a professional designer to really clean it up. Then we had to get 3D renders made. And then we sent it over to our manufacturer in China. The boxes are made in China. The chocolate and anything that touches the chocolate is made in the United States. That's super, super important to me. But, you know, in terms of the box itself, once we have the design file, once we had the 3D render, we sent it over to them and they made their first prototype. And then there's the chocolate itself. In order to create the chocolate, there are like four or five different niche supplement manufacturers. You know, each supplement has its own independent manufacturer because we source the best of the best. And then each chocolate is wrapped in a plastic that has its own, you know, manufacturer. And then, you know, the chocolate doesn't just spawn in this format. There is our logo, the two T's over here, and then there's a clean BR so that, you know, you can break it and split it. Right. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. Get away from me. But yeah, I mean, that's kind of what the whole entire, you know, supply chain looks like.",

So I could tell you like right off the bat, when we sold out, we decided to ship our next order of boxes by boat. And the reason being is that when you ship it by boat, it's own a lot a lot cheaper than shipping. It air fried but it also takes four times as long. So we ordered, you know like I think was like 60 or 70,000 boxes and it was a disaster. The container got delayed and so you know, as a result we basically just put everything on pause. We moved to pre orders but you know, sales just declined, decline, decline, almost went to zero. So you know, there have been many, many times where we've run out of chocolate or we weren't able to forecast demand properly. So what we've been trying to do is just order as much inventory as we possibly can. And which is why we've been reinvesting every dollar back into buying as many boxes and chocol that we can hopefully be prepared. But it's been a perpetual problem. In fact, in our first year of business, we were out of stock for more months than we had stock and we still put up like $4 million. So yeah, pretty proud about that.",

Imagine you could read the exact steps to how someone built a million dollar business and the mistakes they made so you can avoid them when you launch. Well, at Starter Story, we have a library of over 4,000 case studies and business idea breakdowns where you can do backed by real data. For example, Luke joined Starter Story and dove into our case study about a newsletter that makes $25 million a year. Just one month later, he launched his own newsletter that did $5,800 in revenue in the first 30 days. It's simple. He studied what works, implemented it, and avoided the mistakes of people that were just a few steps ahead of him. If you're serious about building something, check out starterstory.com we're running a special deal this week and you can click the link below in the description to get it. Much love and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the video. Peace. Let's talk about the power of a brand. There's a lot of people on YouTube that talk about drop shipping and how it's easy to get started. What's the difference between what you're doing and drop shipping?",

The only people making money through this drop shipping thing are the people that are selling the courses, like secret for you. It's the YouTuber that's behind the camera that's like get into drop shipping. Get into dropshipping. Like not like they're the only ones profiting on that. Drop shipping sucks. You're selling a trendy product in an incredibly saturated market and you have no competitive advantage. Why is the consumer going to buy it from you versus buying it from Amazon? Why are they going to buy it from you versus you know, buying it from the other 150 sellers that are drop shipping the same exact. The answer is that they're not. The power of the brand is dropping a product on your website and in 30 seconds it's sold out. The power of the brand is creating a community and like an identity, you know, between you and your consumers where they live and breathe and die for your. When you unlock something like that, you've made it because it doesn't matter what you sell, it doesn't matter what you drop. You got a cult like following. And on a business sense, what that means is that you have evergreen customers forever. So like when you have new product drops, when you introduce new SKUs, like, you know that people are coming back and you're going to be able to make money off of this customer cohort time and time again. On top of that, you know the brand, you're building equity. The people that make money, I'm talking real money, they don't make it off the cash, they don't make it off the yearly sales, they're making it off the exit. With drop shipping, there is no brand equity which puts you in this really difficult spot to ever build any sort of thing that's concrete or build anything that's of real value because every two months you're, you're closing down shop, opening a new shop, closing down shop, opening a new shop. So at the end of the day, people that are thinking long term and people that are focused on building brands are always going to win.",

I'm like sitting around my house and I was like, this is like the perfect time and opportunity to build something. And so I did just that. And it took. It took a year to go from idea to bring it into reality. You know, it was super slow. Like, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. Like, there were weeks where I wasn't even working on the business because I was waiting on this person or I was waiting on this to get done. I was waiting on this thing for this thing. Like, you know, it didn't just like kind of like materialize overnight. It was a long, long, long process. But once we had product in hand and we had an incredible product that, you know, I poured my blood, sweat and tears into over that hit the ground running. And in our first three weeks, we sold out of all of our inventory. And in our first month, we had to move to pre order and we did over $280,000 in revenue at like 50% net margins because we were just going viral left and right. It was absolutely bonkers.

The product itself A, and then B, like in terms of like developing that sample, like that first initial sample.
