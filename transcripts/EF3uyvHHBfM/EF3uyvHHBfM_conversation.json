And to do that, I wanted multiple years of bank data. I wanted it all in one nice Excel spreadsheet so I could kind of figure out, okay, it looks like I'm spending this much a month. And that was a lot harder than I thought it would be because my bank only provided PDF bank statements. So I wrote some code to get the transaction data out of the bank statements.

And then I convinced a friend to help me build the UI for this and he did this in next JS and then we got the two things deployed.

So I would spend maybe 1000 USD on ads and bring in about 300 USD in sales. I spent a lot of time trying to optimize these ads, trying to get more profitable, but never really worked out. I tried blogging and building in public. That gets quite a lot of attention. However, I don't think I get many users from doing that because my users don't seem to be using Twitter or reading my blog. I also tried sending out cold emails, and in three months of doing that, I got one sale. And I also annoyed a lot of people. I got a lot of angry messages back. People don't really like cold emails. After about six months of running Google search ads, I decided, you know, I'm just not going to do this anymore. I might not even do this app anymore. I cut the ads and I thought maybe go back to work. And interestingly, I stopped paying for ads. So I knew everyone who was clicking on the website was an organic user. And I noticed I started getting new users. I'd get like two or three new signups a day. From that point on, I kind of focused on improving the products. When customers complained about things, I would fix them. And I just basically focused on doing what the customers wanted.",

Banking. The truth is, most banks aren't built for solo founders and SaaS builders. They slow you down with low card limits, delayed payments, and systems that feel like they were made in 2004. That's why we're partnering with Brex, the modern finance platform that's built from the ground up for startups. With Brex, you can get up to 20x higher card limits, earn high yields on your cash, automate expenses, invoices and vendor payments, and move money instantly when you need it. It's fast, flexible, and made to scale with you, no matter how small or scrappy your SaaS is right now. We worked with them to put together a free guide called the Startup's Guide to Modern Banking. It breaks down how to protect your cash, extend Runway, and upgrade your finance stack without wasting time. Just click the first link in the description to download it. Thank you to Brex for supporting the channel. Let's get back to the video. All right, so you got this website, making a bunch of money. It's a great business. You have a team working on this?",

It's kind of a big change when you go from making maybe like US$10,000 a month to 200amonth and you're basically hanging out with no one. So being a solopreneur can be pretty depressing. Another thing is people often don't really get what you're doing, especially when you're failing to make money. I remember in the first two years, people didn't understand why I did it. And they would also hear the revenue and they tell me, oh, this is like a crappy business. You shouldn't go after this. And then multiple years later, when it's making a lot more money, those same people will say like, oh, it's a great business. Some pros, it's good to have your own schedule. Often I wake up and go hiking instead of going to work. It's nice to be like on a different schedule to everyone Else, if you're starting up a VC backed startup, you have a boss, you have investors, you got a lot of time pressure. As a solopreneur, you can go a bit slower, I mean, depending on how much money you have saved up. And you can also go after much smaller markets. A venture capitalist wouldn't want to invest in bank statement converter. It doesn't make enough money, the market's not big enough. But for a single person, you know it's enough. Right?

Building a following on social media is hard work and even if you have it, your business business might still not be very good. So just focus on the business, focus on the products, get some real users, improve the product and it should be easy to get more users if your product solves their problem.

He found a tiny problem, built a solution for himself and then turned it into a life changing business. I think anyone can take this framework and strategy and turn it into their own micro SaaS. If you want to learn more about how to build simple apps, check out Starter Story Build. In about two weeks you'll go from a simple idea to a fully operational app. We'll guide you on how to use AI to build and design your app and then we'll challenge you on how to launch it into the real world.
