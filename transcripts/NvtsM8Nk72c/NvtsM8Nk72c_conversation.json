And then I was working as a freelance react developer in London for various startups, kind of launching things on the side, trying to get something off the ground, and none of them would go anywhere until the first one that kind of made some money, which was a TikTok influencer directory. So scraping TikTok, selling that data as a SaaS business, and that got to a few thousand dollars a month, an mrr, and I sold it. And that kind of bought me a few months off to come up with the next thing, something a bit more sustainable. And I was kind of trying to launch like an IPOS newsletter. I was pulling financial data into Airtable to manage it all there. And that really sowed the seed for what would then become Data Fetcher years later.",

So rather than like manually pulling your data into your Airtable database, you can, you can connect it up using APIs and then schedule that to happen automatically. And it's a super flexible tool. So we have people doing marketing data. So Pulling in like Facebook ads, Google Analytics, we have people doing operations type workflows. So the use cases honestly keep on surprising me, like even five years in. And that's honestly one of the best parts of running the business is seeing what people build of it.",

Kind of the perfect lifestyle business. And having run into this problem on airtable before, I thought, could I build this for this new platform that's taken off? Airtable was just growing super fast and they just launched this marketplace and I kind of validated it by looking at their forums to see what problems people are running into. And there seemed to be this need for like a really flexible tool that was kind of the validation stage.",

      "text": "All right, well, before we get back into how andy built this $23,000 per month micro SA, let's talk about what made this possible. He didn't try to create the next unicorn. He just built a simple tool to solve his own problem. And what started as a small side project completely changed his life. This is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. It's your place to build and launch your side project using AI tools like Lovable and Cursor. And in just a few days, you'll learn how to use AI to build fully working apps and actually launch your project to the world. We've had hundreds of people go through the program and and launch their first side project. So if you're serious about launching something this year, this is where to start. Just head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, let's get back to Andy's story. When it comes to building on platforms like airtable, what are the pros and cons of building on top of a growing platform like airtable?",

    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Yeah, so the main benefit, I guess, is distribution. Right. So being on the marketplace, especially being early to a marketplace like that on a growing platform, you've just got this steady stream of super qualified leads and they trust you because you've been approved by the platform themselves. So the other benefit of it is just it's big enough to kind of change my life financially, but it's not such a big opportunity that there's loads of people raising loads of Money to come and build like $100 million business. So it's kind of in this perfect indie hacker opportunity space where it just like sits in that sweet spot. I guess the main downside is the platform risk. So like your tool becoming kind of redundant overnight. Airtable have been pretty good so far. They've been a great kind of platform to build on. And I look at it as Data fetcher sits in this sweet spot between they have scripting and they have no code imports, but they're unlikely to build. Something goes completely in between the two of them. And so I think it's safe for now. Touchwood. Cool.",

      "end": 285700
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Yeah, of course. So the first step is obviously finding that platform and there's a tool I love for this which is exploding topics. Step two, you then want to find a pain point on that platform and you can look in their forums, on Reddit, on Twitter, you just want to find that use case. Step three is you want to borrow a proven add on or pattern from like a more established platform. So for me that was obviously Google Sheets and airtable and borrow all the kind of like UX from that as well as making it native or feel native to the platform you're on. Step four is you want to check you can integrate with your growing platform. So you want to look for is there a public API, is there a marketplace, an extension SDK? Step five is you want to do some napkin maths to find the size of the opportunity, work out how many users does this platform have, how common is this problem, and then how much are people willing to pay for it? So again, you can use that established platform to look at price points on there and assume they'll be roughly similar on the growing platform. And step six, you want to work out, will the platform crush you? How likely is this platform to build this into their feature set? And so you can look at their roadmap, you can look at their support forums and things like that and work out what kind of noises are they putting out about this feature that you're trying to build as well as how native does it feel like, how likely are they to add this as a native feature? And that's the hardest one to do, right? Because how can we see into the future? But you can use all of the data that you can find on the Internet and just kind of like back into does this feel like an opportunity? And then you Just have to go for it.",

    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Yeah, so I think Notion is a great platform to build on. So it's not the newest tool, but it's still growing like crazy. And the API is relatively new, so I think there's a bunch of opportunities around automation, around reporting, and getting data in and out of Notion. Another one that I love is figma. And so I think there's loads of little opportunities with things like exporting figma to webflow, to Framer, to whatever kind of CMS or web design tool that you want to use, or hosting tool. The last thing I'd say is probably not building on like ChatGPT or Claude. So although there's like huge growth in those tools, everyone and their dog is building for ChatGPT and Claude. Just because there's so much competition, I think you're better off trying to use those tools to superpower your business and your tool.",

And then I found that I could see certain use cases coming up again and again, certain APIs that people connecting to. So I started doing content marketing around those use cases. So writing blog posts, creating YouTube videos on the most popular integrations, and then that just drove it through to like 1k and mrr after a few months and then 3k after a year. And then I realized that I could make it even easier for people. So I started building these no code integrations. So for even less technical people to use Data Fetcher. And that drove it through to 10,000 in MRR after the first year. And then it was just that rinse and repeat for a couple of years. So talking to customers, getting the feedback, building it in, and then telling people about it through content marketing went to 20k after three years.",

So the API and the database, stuff like that for the kind of schedule stuff, the workers that's on Hetzner, which is like a super low cost hosting provider. Help scout for support tickets, fast mail for email, crossable for Unleashed, Mailerlite for the email newsletter, chartmogul for analytics, and then obviously Airtable itself for like product roadmap, content pipeline, everything like that.",

And each time that I was working on them, the thing that I tell myself is that it was because of platform risk or the market saturation or whatever it was, but really it was because growth had slowed and I was getting bored and losing motivation. What I do now, it's a bit weird, but I use Claude as kind of like a business coach. So every time I start to get distracted or I'm not working hard enough, I literally go to Claude and I say, be my business coach and make me focus on the thing that's working and talk me out of trying to launch something new. And I'm embarrassed to say that it actually works pretty well. And so it's almost like having a co founder having that accountability.",
