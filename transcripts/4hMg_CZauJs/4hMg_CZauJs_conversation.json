And so it automatically pulls in your tweets from X and then it has an AI model on top of it that reads all your tweets and is able to coach you on how to create better content. So I started building this in August 2024 when I discovered Cursor. And after about seven or eight months of building this, getting feedback, improving on it, iterating it, and then finally releasing it, we had a really successful launch day. Within 15 minutes I got to $100,000 ARR. And within two weeks I got it to $300,000 ARR. Active paid subscribers. And all I did was build a product that solved my own challenges. And along the way I was able to build a super powerful AI product that I'm able to now run and ship all completely by myself.",

And I've always had the dream of building software, but with a 9 to 5, it was very difficult. And then around December 2021, I started creating content on, at the time, Twitter. So I built this entire system for myself around tweets so that I could have my 9 to 5 while also creating content. And I was like putting tweets in a spreadsheet and seeing what worked and what doesn't. So in March 2023, Elon Musk open sources, the X algorithm code, I immediately open up the GitHub, I go through all the code, and I decided to write a thread on Twitter about the open source algorithm. I go over, like, how it works, sort of the different variables in it, like how things go viral. And that thread I wrote on the algorithm goes super viral. Elon retweets it, Mark Cuban engages with it. When I get hundreds of thousands of followers, I decided, like, I have a once in a lifetime opportunity here. I have this massive audience behind me. If I can figure out a way to build something, I can build a real business. And so I quit my job, went all in, and eventually came upon the idea of creator buddy and launched it.",

And within five minutes of using Cursor, I have this realization that hits me that's like, I can, with cursor, build enterprise level software, software that required teams of hundreds of people before now completely by myself, no help whatsoever. And so I had a working prototype. Day one, I go to my community on X. I say, hey, this is what I built. What do you think? What can I add that makes this more helpful? And then I just spent the next six, seven months getting feedback, improving, getting feedback, improving until I hit the point in January this year where I felt like, okay, this is ready to launch. People are going to be willing to pay money for this.",

And what I've kind of figured out is basically the smaller you can break down your problems, your challenges, your requests, the better your results will be. So let's say I'm trying to build a feature around AI brain dumps, right? What I would do is I would try to break that feature down into the smallest building blocks possible. So my first request would be, hey, can you build an input where a user can enter in an essay or a brain dump? It would do that. And Then I go, okay, next, I want you to build a button that will eventually repurpose the content. And they build the button, and I go, okay, now I want you to command the AI model to take that essay and turn it into a tweet. And while it seems like that would take much longer, you actually get done a lot more and a lot faster because you're not going to run into bugs that way. And a little hack there. If you actually have ChatGPT up on the side, you can say, here's a feature I want to build. Can you break it down into micro steps and then just take that output and put it into cursor? So that really is the biggest key, breaking it down into micro steps for the AI.",

And, oh, man, he delivered. If you want to see the way that Alex builds with cursor, watch over his shoulder and see how he builds an MVP from scratch the right way. I put a link in the description to that. It's free to watch, and I think you're going to love it. This is one part of Starter Story Build, which I'd also love if you checked out.

And as I talked about earlier, like, I was putting my tweets in spreadsheets every night and reviewing my tweets so I can figure out what's working, what isn't. I'm like, okay, I'm going to build software that makes that process easier so I can automate reviewing my tweets. Automate collecting my tweets. And odds are, if you have that challenge, someone probably has it as well. The worst case scenario, if you build products that solve your own challenges, is that you just make your life easier. So build software that solves those challenges and then share that out with your audience, and eventually you're going to find other people that have those same challenges.",

You can beta test Creator Buddy. You can just try it out. I got this in the hands of, I think I had 150 beta testers. I met with each and every one of them to walk through how it worked and what they should be doing. And once I had it in people's hands, that's when I made the most improvements because I started seeing what people actually were using, what they were clicking on, where they were having challenges, where the bottlenecks were. I beta tested till the day before launch. So January 12th, I announced I'm launching on January 24th. I go live on spaces that day. I talk about Creator Buddy the entire day because I was sharing my journey for like the six, seven months leading up to this day. I had hundreds of people ready to buy minute one of launch. We hit launch, I go for a 45 minute walk. I come back to 10 trillion DMs and messages. Hey, this is broken. This doesn't work. Can you fix this? And I'd like to tell you that, you know, a successful launch day where I'm making 200k on day one, was all roses and sunshine.

So, yes, you can build an app in a weekend and you can launch fast, go viral, hit 100k ARR in hours. But things like slow payments, low limits and no flexibility might be the thing that actually breaks your business. That's why we're partnering with Brex, the modern finance platform built to help startups spend smarter and move faster. Brex rebuilt cards and banking specifically for startups. You get up to 20 times higher card limits, built in, expense tracking and rewards that actually help you grow. And their banking product goes even deeper. High yield returns, same day liquidity, and automated payments that save you time and protect your Runway. One in three US startups use Brex, and we worked with them to put together a free guide called the Startup's Guide to Modern Banking. Head to the first link in the description to download it. Thank you to Brex for supporting the channel. All right, let's get back to Alex's Story. I can Already read the YouTube comments right now as, okay, this is not interesting to me.

But at the same time, I have an audience because I spent three years creating content. Right. A big reason why I blew up on Twitter so much is I was able to quickly form opinions around the way the algorithm worked, the way the platform worked, and I was able to express those opinions quickly. And people formed around that and built a community around that. And all I did was consistently make content for three years before I launched a product, create content for a long time, create YouTube videos, tweet. Right? It took me five minutes a day to tweet, do that. And then you can have an audience too, and you can make money. So, yes, an audience is a big reason why I made money.

Supabase for data, Supabase is extremely Easy to use. $20 a month for Supabase. Other than that, I pay for the AI API, so I use Claude, I use Chad GPT, I use a couple others. And all in all together, I think I pay about $250 a month. My emails are done through Resend, which is like an email API. I pay $5,000 a month for the X API, which not many people are willing to spend that much for that data. So the costs altogether come out to about $5,300 a month. And on $25,000 a month of revenue, I think that puts it right around 80% margins, which are even with the insane Twitter API costs are pretty good.",

I'm going to hire a thumbnail consultant or I'm going to hire whatever. I'm just going to go to AI and just figure it out. And if you change your mindset to figure it out mode, you can do anything. You can have a one person business with absolutely no help whatsoever. And then two, now that anyone can build any software they want, knowledge and product is no longer the moat. The moat is your distribution. You know, how can I get as many eyes and attention on this as possible? Because that's going to be my moat. Someone goes out and Builds creator Buddy 2.0 the exact same app in five seconds, but they have 10 followers, I'm going to outsell them in circles, right? They're not even know about the other person's app. So I always make sure no matter what I'm doing, I'm always putting my community first so that I can maintain that distribution so I can keep selling my product.",

If you don't know what to tweet about, just tweet anything. One or two things will happen. You either figure out what works or what doesn't work. See, either. Tweet something and you'll get no likes. Okay, that doesn't work. I can move on to the next thing. Or you'll build something and it won't work. Okay, I can build something else. Or you've discovered, okay, this does work.
