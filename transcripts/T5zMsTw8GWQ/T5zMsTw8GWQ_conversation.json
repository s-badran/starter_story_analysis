I wanted something that would allow me to finish, have my coffee in the morning without having to stand at a bus stop for 10, 20 minutes in the rain. And that was the initial idea behind the app for any developer, any idea you have asked to be something that you. A problem that you yourself have. If it works for you, there's a good chance it'll work for lots of other people.",

At this point, I didn't have any experience with smartphone app development. I turned to some of, some of my coding experience in the past for websites. And so the first few versions of the app were built in Xamarin that uses C. Net. That's what I was comfortable with at the time. It was a really tough process because the paradigm of creating an iOS and Android app is so different from creating a website. It was months of building, failing, tweaking. And once it was launched, I was able to spend some time making the code better because it was a mess at this point. Swift had been around for a few years and Flutter had just, just been released. So I took a few months to rebuild the app in native Swift on iOS. And because of the way the app works with maps and, and sliding panels, Flutter was perfect. So was able to rebuild very quickly within two or three months.",

      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Okay. With App Store optimization there are three basic steps. Step one, you want to find in this case location specific keywords. Things like New York, subway, Chicago train. Add those to the title and metadata of the app. That will start process of the app appearing in searches for those specific keywords. But it wasn't until I did some research that growth really happened. First of all, I could see that different cities use different terminology. So for example, in New York you've got the MTA subway and Chicago you have the CTA L train. Once I started adding these kind of keywords, I found that downloads increased substantially. At the same time also updated screenshots. So they're much more location specific. So each localization would have its own set of screenshots. To hone in on the fact that this app works for where you are right now. The next step was to use other localizations. So for example, if you were to add keywords to Mexican Spanish, those same keywords would be indexed for the US App Store and have the same weight as the native US English localization. Step two was to find more keywords that worked. You have two choices. You can use Apple Search ads. Start testing a few keywords at a time to see which ones convert. Or using the app store itself, search for terms, keywords and phrases around what your app does. By typing in the first few characters into search, you'll see a list come up and most people, when you start typing will see the list appear and tap on the first or second entry. So by looking at those lists, I was able to determine what are the most high impact keywords people are searching for for. And the best thing about this is, is because they are very specific, they don't have a huge popularity. So by targeting those keywords specifically in the right place at the right time, you can quite easily get into the top five for a keyword. And step three, asking for ratings within the app. At this point, you should be at the top 10 for the keywords you're looking to target. If an app wants to get to number one, it needs ratings coming in all the time. You need to have golden moments where you can ask for a rating. This case it could be when you tap on a and see a live tracking of a bus or train, you can actually see it moving on the map. That's a great moment to ask the customer for a rating where the customer is most likely to respond positively. If you can get those ratings coming in, your app will rise organically to the top for all the keywords that you're targeting.",

John didn't just build a cool app. He built a real business that means dealing with taxes, bookkeeping, and all the admin stuff that has nothing to do with actually building.

All right, let's get back to the story. Let's switch topics a little bit to the growth of an app like this. I really want to understand what it takes to grow an app like yours from zero to $30,000 a month. Can you walk me through kind of the journey there?",

But then the pandemic hit and suddenly my ad revenue just disappeared. I knew I needed to pivot quickly. At this point, subscriptions were becoming more mainstream. So I rebuilt the app with subscriptions in mind with premium features that would entice people to pay on an annual basis. In August 2020, that new update was released. And over the next year, it grew and grew and eventually replaced the missing ad revenue. But in 2021, this is when the real growth happened because finally started to use a B testing, I started creating different paywalls to see which one performed better. And over the course of maybe two or three months, with maybe 10 experiments, I was able to increase the conversion rate from 0.5% all the way up to 8% despite just by optimizing the onboarding and paywall. And suddenly growth skyrocketed, going from around 8k a month to over $30,000.",

      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Okay. This is the first launch of the app and it's really designed to very quickly show the value of the app because most people who are downloading and installing the app are doing so at a bus stop or a train station. So there's no time for a 20 screen onboarding. First of all, quickly ask for your location because that's one of the most important permissions for this app. And then shows you a few screens about what you're going to get from this app. Not just bus tracking, but all the extra features. And this is kind of setting it up for the paywall that's to come. It shows a bit of social proof, right? It says join millions saving time and this gets a customer prepared. And that's the paywall itself. It's got, got three different options. Seven day free trial for a yearly plan, you have a weekly plan for a low commitment and for people who just don't like subscriptions, you've got a lifetime plan. Now the great thing here is after a lot of experimentation, what I've found is a real unlock is for people who just tap on the close button, the app starts a reverse trial. So if I close it just now it says enjoy a week of pro on us. And now you have 7 days free trial of all. The pro feature starts without you having to pay or without you having to make any kind of commitment at this point you've got a few screens showing what you get from pro, showing off all the, all the details. Finally you're in the app. And now I can see everything around me. I can just move around the map and I've just choose a little bus stop here. And what I can do here is I can just tap on a departure and this is real magic moment. This is where you can actually see the bus on the map. It's moving and if I tap on go, it will turn on trip assist and then at that point I won't just track where I am. I've got machine learning set up on the server that will keep track of my what's happening up ahead on my journey. So if there's a train or bus that's delayed or I'm going to miss a connection, the server would know and send me a notification and offer me an alternative route and that's the Real kind of magic of the app.",

And secondly, for the first couple of years I was relying on vanity metrics to see how well I was doing things like monthly active users. That was the one moving the needle. It was only when I moved to event based analytics that growth really happened. Being able to set up a B test for different paywalls to see which one is more effective.
