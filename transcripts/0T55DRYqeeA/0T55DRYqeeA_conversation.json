Our core users are pretty much beginners to Sami developers and they can attach this knowledge base to these AI coding tools. So you can say CodeGuide is just a bridge between two parties.

And I built a lot of agencies, built a lot of software products, SaaS, products, you name it. And then in 2022, I was actually writing a lot of tweets about AI prompting. And I knew that AI coding is actually blowing up at the back end and people are not noticing it. So I wanted to force myself to actually learn the craft, build and code with AI coding tools for like 10 to 12 hours per day. And I just, you know, publicly announced that I'll be doing 12 startups and I ended up building 11 products of my own. Unfortunately, 10 collapsed. They didn't perform well, but one of them grew really fast, which is codeguide. And then in the end, you know, it was just like an overnight success after like all these seven years.

So I turned my prompts into like a sequence using make.com and I literally saved seven hours out of those nine hours. And that was magical for me.

I just tweeted that out and I was just mind blown that how many people were actually struggling with hallucination problem with AI and then I just turned this thing into a landing page in like 20 minutes. The max using both and actual validation for me was when people starting to sign up. So I got more than 1800 waitlist emails in like two weeks. That was the first stage of validation for me that people actually want this solution. And then I was just talking to all the beta users, I was trying to DM them, every single one that was commenting me just to asking them either they are using some other flow to remove or fix the AI hallucinations and nobody was actually tackling in a better way than what we were trying to do.

Once I did that, I realized I can't do it myself because I have to launch it fast. So I just reached out to my friend and I said, hey, I'll take care of the front end and the marketing side. Can you do the back end and just the customer service? And he was very stoked about this idea because we were coding with AI for all these months, so now he take care of the back end still. We're just team of two and I take care of the front end. So it took us just two weeks to actually from just the raw UI to have a proper responsive web app launched for our users.

You gotta try a lot of things, but when you finally find something that works, you're ready. And I really think that space right now is building in AI. Look, these AI coding tools are powerful, but they're still not magic yet. It's still really early days and the space can feel overwhelming if you don't have the right system or framework to follow. So shameless. Plug here. But we've been working on something for a while. It's called Starter Story Build our platform for learning everything AI tools in Vibe Coding, Our flagship program is the AI App Accelerator, where in about two weeks without knowing how to code, you'll ideate, build and launch a real life production app using all AI tools just like cj. We've been running this program for a while behind the scenes and. And every day I'm blown away by the stuff being built in there and just how fast things are moving. But this is way more than something you could get in the course because you walk away with a real world app completely built with AI plus skills that might just change your life. Not only will you learn how to use these tools and to build stuff you never thought possible, but the program will also give you structure, accountability, and push you to actually take action, get it done and ship it. What's even cooler is that we have office hours with AI coding experts to help you when you get stuck and a whole cohort of other people building alongside you. So if you're curious about building an app like CJ and you want to surround yourself with other builders in AI, then head to the first link in the description to see if the AI app accelerator might be worth it for you. But we're keeping it small right now because we're focused on quality. So please make sure to head to that first link. Put your email in if you want to save your spot. Now let's get back to cj. Okay, so you launched it. This kind of tweet thread blew up. Let's go deeper into the marketing. What's been working for you to market your SaaS and grow the SaaS since then?",

I would literally go push content for next 14 days, warm up my audience, and then from there I pick up what are their main core pain points and for those pain points, what is the major one. And then I just build a product that fixed just one problem and then I pushed that product to that core group that gave me my initial users and from their own words, I would just double down on the content that works and I will find more people like the core audience. And that's how you can grow. And I coined this term called tutorial marketing. And what I do every single day is I just write a tutorial in the form of thread or long form tweet. And what I do is I write four threads per week and three long form posts. I just pick one topic, write a draft, and then the next day I just edit that draft with clearmind. Then I design assets using Canva and Figma. So in this tutorial, same playbook in the hook, you actually talk about the problem and then you show them the exact a blueprint. What's the ideal solution? And then you position your SaaS in between, just a part of the solution, that type of content actually performs really well because that's bookmarkable content and shareable content. If your content is bookmarked, algorithm is in your side and people love that and you build credibility and trust.

Basically this is our main IDE where we code all our stuff. That costs us $20. Windsurf is another AI IDE that we use $15 a month. Supabase. All our backend is PostgreSQL Supabase, so $25 a month and that covers our database and storage. Vercel is where we deploy all our apps, so $48 a month. Hetzner is basically our cloud storage server. It costs us $25. The biggest bill is OpenAI API, which is $2,800. Then we also use Claude API and that costs us 300 plus dollars. Gemini flash API is free right now. Clerk Dev is for user authentication. That's a very good tool. Then we use ConvertKit to send emails to our users. That costs US$45 a month. So all in all, cost is around like $3,500 per month.
