I was like, why don't I just utilize my pre existing skill set? AI GPT3 is now out. A few businesses know about it. Maybe I could help provide some value to like some small mid sized businesses who want to learn more about AI. Around that time that I got that idea, people actually started reach to me asking about my experience at OpenAI. I had a kind of like tab on my LinkedIn that showed that I had worked on use cases for OpenAI for the GPT3 beta. They started asking me certain things. It got to the point where I started charging for the advice that I was giving. In July of 2022 I met with the publishing company where I got the idea. They showed me their stats and how much money they were making off of selling books. That was a complete eye opener for me. I did realize how many people bought books per month. Their revenue was about $2 million, which was absolutely insane to me. I thought why can't I just start up something similar? Because what they were doing was so insanely simple. But they were not doing anything AI book related and When I met with them, I told them nothing about my idea that I had kind of formulated while we were on the call. In the month of August, I generated 10, 20 books. I generated a few more in September. By the end of September, I was at 40 bucks. I generated 40 books with AI. Then on October 3rd, I hit my first profitable day. That was like $20. October 4th I was like at $40. And then from there it almost grew exponentially. On December 28th, I'll never forget this day. That's when I hit my first 1k day profit. And that was crazy. That was just after Christmas and my whole family knew about it. I told all my friends.",

When I created my first book, it was probably the worst book anybody could ever read. Like there was no congruency, nothing. As I actually started purchasing my competitors books and Reading through them, I knew exactly what I needed to include. It's not as easy as just putting into ChatGPT. Write me a book on whatever. Initially this wasn't the way I did it, but this is the best way to do it Now. You get ChatGPT to create the book outline. Let's say, for example, you have five chapters and then per each chapter there are five topics. You are going to go through each topic in each chapter and generate that topic. Even though I wasn't super experienced with writing books, people still like them. The first few books that I put out, they they enjoyed what they were reading.",
