So as I was looking through the app stores and looking online for something to help, I realized that there's nothing that really spoke to me. Things were really either clinical or there were hypnosis based apps, and it just really wasn't what I was looking for. So that's why I figured I had something to launch here.",

And so I took these ideas and sketches from my notebooks and then I taught myself how to basically create them as wireframes and Photoshop and Illustrator. And then, yeah, I went to an agency and I could not afford to work with the agency. So that certainly set me back time wise. But then at one point a student developer said that he would love to work with me and so that's how I was able to finally launch that first mvp.",

What I did was I just put in all my savings, you know, as a non technical founder, it just took a few months once I actually had the developer. And that's because all of the content, all of the wireframes before then were already created. I did want to learn enough to at least be able to communicate what I wanted better. I just sort of focused a lot on the design, making sure all that was really simple. The first prototype of Rooted was essentially the panic attack button. That would walk you through a panic attack. And that actually hasn't changed a ton over the years because it's really the core of Rooted. It's the aha moment that really resonates with users. What's changed is the design and the way it looks right now. But that core idea of how to stop a panic attack is still there and rooted after all these years. So I launched with that, a simple breathing tool, and then the lessons on how to understand panic attacks and anxiety and where they're coming from.",

She just had a painful personal problem and decided to build a solution for herself. And that simple decision became a million dollar app. This is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. It's our flagship program where you'll learn to build and launch your project using AI coding tools. Even if you have zero coding experience, in just a few weeks, you'll go from idea to a working production app, just like Anya did. So if you're ready to turn your problem into your next project, head to the link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. Alright, let's get back to the episode. All right, let's jump into the growth side of things. I know that you grew this app from 0 to 4 million plus downloads. What are some of the tactics or maybe the top three things when it comes to growing a mobile or an iPhone app?",

Secondly, I would say press releases. In the early days, I didn't want to be even known as like the anxiety girl. I didn't want that to like, define me. Then I realized, you know, once you actually, actually put your name to a story, it does resonate better with the audiences. I would find people, online journalists that wrote about mental health and then I would read it, reach out to them either on LinkedIn or try to get their email and send pitches that way. It was a ton of work because not many people ever respond to me. But what ended up happening is every now and then we'd get featured in a pretty major way for small apps. So we were in Cosmopolitan, we've been in Women's Health, we were even in Time magazine, which was the big one. All of that really happened from these organic cold emails. And then the third thing would be a huge focus on App Store optimization. So I focused a lot on making sure that the product matches what the users are looking for. They see on your product page, they download the app, they use it, and then they use the same keywords to describe their experience via the user reviews. That was like the holy circle. And if you can get that loop going it I think it's a really strong presence for App Store optimization. That's great.",

That'll lead not only to more positive downloads, AKA like people leaving positive experiences, but people also then share it. And like the word of mouth engagement is qu important. Step two, listen to your users. So user reviews are super important. Oftentimes everything you need to know is written in the user reviews. And sometimes your own assumption of what a user needs might not actually be what they do need. Step three, optimize app store presence. Continuously doing a release frequently shows that you continue to work on the app. I do one once every week and that shows that you're constantly working on fixing bugs, improving the user experience. And step four, partner strategically. So be that a wellness organization. We've done a few B2B contracts as well. A ton of different therapy groups and psychologist offices are recommending and using Rooted and this has been something that's been helpful. Now in 2025, one thing that I'm.",

And this is really, really important to me. Users leave comments about how rooted has helped them go back to work, go back to school, just reclaim confidence in their lives. We've also realized that based on usage that we're able to now take a panic attack. And users are feeling better from the panic attack within under two minutes. It's just been really exciting to work on that and kind of see really how effective Rooted is and what users say about it. I think actually our focus on tracking user reviews and the quality of rooted over revenue has been a big factor as to why we've Grown.",

      "text": "Yeah. So when you first open the app, you're greeted with this blue app mascot named Ron. The main feature here is if you're in the middle of a panic attack, you'll see this red button. This is an SOS button, and it'll basically ask you how you're feeling based on either wanting to feel okay in the moment or wanting to face the panic attack head on. And it walks you through these prompts which help to essentially activate the parasympathetic nervous system. And the parasympathetic nervous system is the one that calms us down. There's also this tool for deep breathing. And probably my favorite features are these lessons. They're actually lessons on understanding anxiety, what the physical mental effects are, the causes and theories and so forth. We also have a journal tool where you can kind of share what your feelings are, share what you've accomplished, what's weighing you down, what you're grateful for. We also have over 100 visualizations and sleep sounds. And then most recently, we have a games tool. And these are supposed to be really simple, relaxing games. Users have asked for this for many years. So the idea is for the games to be really simple things that you can play when you are on a plane or in a busy subway. Just things to kind of distract you when you're feeling a little anxious in the moment. Now that we have as many downloads as we have, whenever I launch something, I almost instantly, like within a week, I get to see thousands of people use it. Right. So that's just been incredible.",

And just to have a pulse on what users are saying, I'd also recommend taking care of yourself along the way. I think there were definitely quite a few points where I almost reached burnout. I was building something really intense and that level of intensity was with me at all times. And I think I looking back, I wish I celebrated a few of the smaller moments more because now I realize that those were like the most awesome moments.
