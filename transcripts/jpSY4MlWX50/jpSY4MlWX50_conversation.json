And one day I ended up knocking on the wrong door and someone literally grabbed me and held a knife to my throat. After that, I just had enough. And I wasn't really employable as a student, so I dove into every side hustle that I could. So I did web design, I did copywriting, sales funnels. I became kind of like a generalist. It paid enough to get my way through university. When I was in university, I did computer game development. But funny story, I actually completely sucked at code. I was very visual and I just couldn't understand it. But now AI can actually code for you. And so the limitations that I had before are kind of removed. AI can do the heavy lifting in terms of code and kind of patch up the area where I'm not the best at.",

I got really frustrated one day that none of the things that I did really got me where I wanted to be. So I was pursuing creator led services and products. Just work with creators. And the idea of a database came to my mind and I just started bailing it out because it's something I'd use myself. And I figured with AI I could turn this into a fully fledged SaaS if enough people wanted it. So I really just gave it a spin as kind of like an experiment and it did pretty good.",

I was like, okay, how long is this going to keep going for? And that night got about 20 or 30 different sales.

So it has all the documentation, anything that you want to, any tool, any library, just tell it you're a complete noob and absolutely don't know how to do anything. And it'll give you really detailed step by step because it's deep research. It'll pull up a long document that you can reference and just follow along. The next step is I'd pull up Bolt and just take it one step at a time as well. So I would implement the first thing that Perplexity says. So it could be like the dashboard, importing the project, cloning a GitHub repository. If there is, once I'm in there, I just keep prompting it and if there's errors, I just throw the error back at the AI. It fixes the error onto the next thing and I Use both to a point where I get a nice looking MVP with the functionality and then I take that, download the project, I put it into Cursor and here is where I hook up like Supabase. So it writes all the scripts to connect the backend and I get clerk Auth. And that makes it very simple to plug and play the authentication. And this is all steps that Perplexity can provide for you. So you can just ask questions along the way and it'll give you some solutions. Perplexity is a great starting point. Bolt is a great way to make the mvp. And then you move to Cursor to dial in the details so you're 80% of the way there. And Cursor will then just get you to the final finish line. Have users authenticating you have a backend with real data and with a bit of prompting and some scoring, it'll make it secure as well.",

But if you don't understand your customer or what they're searching for and how they describe their problems, then you're just building fast in the wrong direction. That's why we're excited to partner with Semrush for this video. It's one of the best tools out there for figuring out what people actually want. You can plug in an idea and see what people are searching for, what's getting traffic and where the gaps are. It's got 26 billion plus keywords across 140 countries. And yeah, most people think that it's just an SEO tool, but trust me, it's way more than that. You can use it to validate your idea before you build. Find high intent keywords your competitors are ignoring, or even spin up landing pages that match what people are already looking for. I'm going to show you how you can find successful business ideas just like Polyous in SEMrush with OneSearch. Right now go to Semrush and find their topic research tool. Search any topic or niche. Let's just do TikTok influencer since that's kind of similar to Polyous business. But you could literally just search anything. And I'm going to open some of the cards that look interesting. Like this one. TikTok Influencer Marketing on here you can see all the questions people are literally plugging into search engines. These are the real problems people have and are actively looking for a solution. I like this one because it's not a super high keyword difficulty and there's high volume of people searching for it. So maybe there's some low hanging fruit in there. And look right here. TikTok influencer search platform what's the best way to hire TikTok influencers? Polyus's business can literally be tied back to a single page in Semrush and that's just crazy powerful if you ask me. Right now they're offering a free seven day trial to try out all 55 tools in the platform. Just head to the first link in the description if you want to try it out. All right, let's get back to it. We talked about the code building an mvp. Let's talk about one thing that I think is really cool about your stuff is how good it looks. How do you use AI to design amazing looking websites?",

The most important part is just to get out, focus on just editing the template really quick and just put it out there.",

And I try to have it use like shadcn components and they're all free. But when I have ideas and when you have ideas for how you want onboarding flow to be or some other elements of the app, what I would suggest is just creating something in Figma you can doodle if you want.

It got close to 500k impressions and I think the reason it worked is because I found an angle to attach it to trends happening in the space. A lot of people when they're building in public never go viral because they never join the bigger conversation. And human attention span is limited, so it's 100 times easier to just bring your ideas to where the focus is already happening. So this post had, you know, a nice simple visual demo, has like real, like raw human, like reaction.

What's not worked for me and what I see is there's been like a lot of competitors and copycats that come up, but they never really take off because either they're copying the exact same thing and people see right through that and you need an edge that no one can easily copy with AI tools nowadays.

If you guys started right now and started playing with these tools and shipping stuff, imagine where you'd be in two weeks. Yes, it's early and not everything is perfect, but the early bird gets the bag.
