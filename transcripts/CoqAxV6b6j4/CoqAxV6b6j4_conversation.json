SaaS has quite a lot of components, not just about building the tech aspect of it, but rather there's whole suite of things. Payments, authentication, databases, marketing, SEO. So it took me a few years to gain proficiency in all these aspects. Consistency is the only thing that helped. You know nowadays with tools like deep research and AI assisted coding tools like Windsurf, Cursurf, it has become a lot more easier to build as well as maintain these apps alongside what whatever you're doing full time. Nowadays I mostly treat my SaaS apps like they are in autopilot mode just allocate Saturday afternoon couple of hours to do updates or quick bug fixes.",

So 2018 to 2020 I just got my feet wet into entrepreneurship. I did not have any entrepreneurship background so I was just testing the waters. So I started writing all about my experiments on LinkedIn and Twitter. Eventually people started following me and asking questions and waking up every day and writing online on this platform. Forms became my point of comfort. And during 2021 and 2022 is when I took all my learnings and launched a Udemy course and that made like $10,000 in revenue till now. That was a good turning point for my let's say slow cooked entrepreneurship journey in 2022. 2023 I learned no code tools and created the first version of Question AI. No beautiful UI, just two text boxes left and right. Then I realized the bottlene thing and thought of just learning Full Stack with the latest and greatest tech. Spent six months and fully ported Question to modern tech Stack for Super Meme. Since I knew the pain of growing a solo startup I wanted to take a different route. So I partnered with the Full Stack developer. I'm the AI guy and there is another marketer that worked out well about a year, year and a half before I took up a full time job as well and I'm quite happy that it all worked out.",

All right, let's get back to the video. Let's talk about ideas. You have two successful ideas. I imagine you've had some that haven't worked out. How did you find these ideas?

That's where the key is. So let's take for example, question AI. Back in 2020, the first thing that we identified was large ethic companies and publishing companies do a lot of quiz creation. We saw that there's potential here, but AI wasn't there yet to deliver automated quiz creation from text. But we could foresee that this quiz generation AI could grow significantly in the next few years. So that was our insight. You should always keep a tab on where generative AI is headed so that you can identify new business use cases that the new AI technology can unlock which was previously not possible or complex or costly.",

For example, for Question, before even building the product, I used to write a lot of blogs about quiz generation, create some videos on YouTube, things like that. Every single day I used to show up on LinkedIn, write about stuff that I'm working on. Both Question AI and SuperMeme AI. Even before hitting any viral we completely built them in public. Sometimes I used to get 10 likes, sometimes 100 likes, 400 likes. So the algorithm keeps changing all the time, but consistency matters a lot. That's how I found even co founders for my app. They saw my posts and we just got together. So I would say the biggest thing was social media founder led content sharing. That's how we got all of our first users iterated on initial MVPs that we built. After that we launched on Product Hunt and luckily with the initial set of users who were our champions through our social media they helped us. And also the virality factor of AI Meme Generator got us to number one on Product Hunt on the launch day for Super Meme.",

Even if you want to just purely use chained workflow app, then there are automations that you can create with tools like make or n8n or zapier etc. Right? So whenever you have an issue or you come across an idea that can be built, build a minimum viable prototype of it using these tools. The other thing is to follow tech updates very closely because you could identify new use cases that can be built on top of them.

I put a link in the description, but basically in 12 days you'll come up with an idea, build it, launch it, and have a real life production app by the end. This is for anyone actually serious about building stuff and potentially creating an app that could change your life. I'll put the link in the description if you want to check it out, but otherwise I'll see you guys in the next one. Peace.",
